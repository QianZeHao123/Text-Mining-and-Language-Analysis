1,Misleading Image of Item,"Be aware that the image shown is not the true product you will receive. The product I received is the new blend ""from the makers of Maxwell House"". The new blend tastes a lot differently from the original blend. I ordered the product from Amazon.com because it gave the impression they had the original blend. I would not have ordered it if I had known otherwise....and it is a non-returnable product. I feel this is very misleading and unfair.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52WQA"">General Foods International Coffee, French Vanilla Cafe Coffee Drink Mix, 9-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>"
5,Delicious,"I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor."
5,Delicious!,"This is the best chai I've ever had in my life.  Well, except when I'm in the mood for something mellower and I get Big Train Vanilla instead.  At any rate, what a deal!  Buy two of these, get Amazon's free shipping!  What's not to love?<br /><br />Also, anyone who was disappointed in the caffeine content might look into the Spiced Decaf or Green Tea chai also made by Big Train.  I can't vouch for the decaf, but the packet of Green that I bought had 2 grams of caffeine per serving and a nice subtle minty touch added to the spicy taste we all know and love."
3,Bought on Recommendation,"I bought this Organic catnip because it came up as one of Amazon's RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU options. Without looking at reviews or checking any other prices, I got it immediately because I was out of Catnip and are the proud owner of 4 felines.<br /><br />I put this on the kidders' favorite toys and pieces of kitty furniture as soon as it arrived. No one was very impressed, but I thought they just might be having an off day. I had just acquired 2 new kittens and tempers were a bit thin with some fur persons. Then I went to PetCo one afternoon and found a wonderful toy for the kitter who was most annoyed. It was a huge markdown and had a huge pad where this one could play alone (just the thing in her case). The toy even provided a small scratching area made of carboard. So I took it home and put it together for ""Miss Annoyed With The New Kittens"". Then I got the tin of Sojos organic catnip out and put it on th scratching area. Miss Annoyed usually goes ape for catnip. She likes to eat it and then enjoy the side effects of this happy candy. She went to the new  toy and was very interested in playing, but ate a mouthful of nip, shook her head and walked away. That was my clue that something was quite amiss.<br /><br />Since I needed to get these 4 guys to bond, I went back to Amazon and began looking for catnip again. I found Yeowww! catnip (in a huge tub) AND DID READ THE REVIEWS. This product got great reviews, so I ordered it immediately. I needed HELP!!!!![<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FDD1NQ"">Yeowww! Catnip Tub 4 oz</a>[ASIN:B0002O0126 Yeowww! 100% Organic Loose Catnip, Leaf and Bud Blend, 1 Ounce Pouch]] It arrived the next day. As soon as I had the tub open, I applied this catnip to the scratching area of ""Miss Annoyed's"" toy and sat back to see what would happen when I showed her the new catnip. She began to munch away and became ""Miss Agreeable.""<br /><br />Perhaps my Sojos Catnip was old or stale, but it should have been fine in its tin. But my cats just did not like it. ""The Other Brand"" made a huge impression on all of them though. So, I am leaning towards feeling that something MAY have bee Off in the Sojos that I got. Therefore, I will give it 3 stars. Sorry it was not accepted more readily at my home, but then the facts are the facts and the kitters like the Other.<br /><br />It happens to be December as I write, so:<br /><br />Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year:<br /><br />SIGNED:<br /><br />Gabriella (age 3); Trinity (3 1/2); Wisdom, sometimes known as Black Majic (5 mo); and Mercy (5 mo).

5,These chips are addictive!,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7 Ounce Bag (Pack of 12)</a>  I first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in KY.  They are not available where I live, so I ordered them from Amazon.  WOW!  My friends and family are all addicted to them.  The spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite.  Once a bag is open, it is gone!"
1,Terrible artificial sweetener taste,This juice has a terrible artificial sweetener taste and such an ingredient should have been listed in the description. It tastes like a DIET soda instead of fruit juice.
5,These are so easy!,"I can make cookies anytime + leave plain or put nuts/decorations on.  Convenient pouches, not alot of ingreds to put together.  I just don't have the time anymore to make cookies from scratch that often.  These taste really good and I use subscribe + save to get them cheaper!"
5,EXCELLENT BUY !,I am new to the use of yuzu kosho but I immediately fell in love with the taste and versatility of this product(I have purchased the green one too: very good as well) .
5,Excellent for my senior cats!,"I can't guarantee for everyone, but this food really works for my tough to feed seniors. As cats age their renal systems begin to gradually fail. My experience with cats in various stages of renal failure is to feed them whatever is palatable enough to keep their weight up. Not give weird diets that restrict protein. The ""renal"" diets that many large companies have been trying to push totally ignore the fact that a cat in any stage of renal failure will fail faster if losing weight due to unpalatable ""renal"" or low protein foods. Our renal tests here confirm that they are very early stage after 3 years of solely worrying about weight loss. My 3 cats are all 18 and one of the three had improved numbers for her last BUN last month and the other 2 low 40s with no crystals. We still experience chronic UTIs with one, but that's always been an issue for her, her weight is incredible and she bounces back immediately from them.<br /><br />As for the smell of poo that some people complain about in these high quality foods, really! If you don't like smelly poo, DO NOT have cats."
5,My dog loves them,"My dog is a very picky eater, but I thought I would give these treats a try and he loves them. He's a tiny five pound Chorkie so they are a perfect size for him and even if you had a bigger dog they'd be great for training."
5,"I'll take Barrys, but I prefer Lyons!",And that's pretty much all there is to say!  You can't beat Lyons for a black tea.  The taste is fantastic.
5,Refreshing,"This is a delightful, refreshing drink that is not loaded with sugar and artificial flavors.  Very delicious and thirst-quenching.  Highly recommended."
5,Yumme,These oats are not only gluten-free they are also yumme. They cook fast and are healthy for you and your family. We love them.
5,You will not find a better tasting butter,"The Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with the most expensive French butter. I actually prefer Lurpak over expensive brands like Beurre d'Echire, Celes-sur-Belle, or Isigny-Ste-Mere.<br /><br />Lurpak is a true lactic, or cultured, butter, and it is full of flavor. Therefore a warning is in order: once you start using this stuff there is no going back. Land O'Lakes simply will not do anymore and you will be stuck searching for this stuff wherever you go from then on."
3,"yes it's delicious, but be informed","from wikipedia: In the United States, Castoreum has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a food additive, often referenced simply as a ""natural flavoring"" in the product's list of ingredients. It is commonly used in both food and beverages, especially as vanilla and raspberry flavoring.<br /><br />Castoreum (pronunciation: /k√¶'st'ri'm/) is the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature North American Beaver Castor canadensis and the European Beaver Castor fiber. Within the zoological realm, castoreum is the yellowish secretion of the castor sac in combination with the beaver's urine, used during scent marking of territory. Both male and female beavers possess a pair of castor sacs and a pair of anal glands located in two cavities under the skin between the pelvis and the base of the tail. The castor sacs are not true glands (endocrine or exocrine) on a cellular level, hence references to these structures as preputial glands or castor glands are misnomers.<br /><br />/wikipedia entry<br /><br />i USED to love raspberry flavored everything, and used the heck out of this extract.  i always assumed the natural flavorings had something to do with raspberries, not beaver butt."
4,Better than its low price suggests,"My four year old Beagle's coat has improved by switching from Pedigree to Rachael Ray. His stool is much firmer now which should help reduce discomfort from impacted anal glands (I also give him ground organic flax seed as a supplement).<br /><br />By comparison, the primary ingredient in Pedigree is corn. With Rachael Ray, the primary ingredients are chicken and rice. It still contains some corn and animal fat but its further down on the list of ingredients. You can tell the difference in quality when you first open the bag -- it smells like proper food. Cheap dog foods tend to stink up the room.<br /><br />I even sampled a few kibbles for myself and found them to be reasonably tasty, like a snack food.<br /><br />I gave it four stars rather than five because it contains cheaper filler grains like corn meal and brewers rice. Among low-cost dog foods, this is arguably the best available option."
5,Delicious,"These are a delightful treat.  We always run out of Snickers Peanut Butter Squares at our house.  Don't be fooled - it looks like a single bar in the larger format, but there are actually two squares in the package.  Our home family enjoys the delicious peanut-buttery taste (is peanut-buttery a word?).  In fact, we would like some now, but Mom ate them all.  We are ordering more right now!"
5,Best Blue Diamond Almonds,"I have tried most of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and I have to say this one is my FAVORITE!!!  Once I start eating these almonds, it's hard to stop.  YUMMY!!!"
5,wonderful,It was a huge hit for staff to receive this for a job well done. Everything arrived in good shape despite the summer heat! Can't go wrong with this gift.
5,Great GF Pasta,"This pasta is great, with some potato added to the usual GF mix. Tastes like ""real"" pasta to me."
5,Green Mountain Half-Caff K-cups,"You actually have me listed as purchasing a different item.  I purchased the 72 count not the 24count, which is a much better deal.  Hope that you offer the larger quantities more often.  Love the half/caff - just enough kick and great tasting."
1,5 seconds of flavor...  :(,"Not worth the money or time- bummer. I would not recommend this type of gum to anyone young or old. They stick to dental work too, YUCK!"
5,Favorite!,This is my absolute favorite coffee flavor out there!  I'm so glad it comes in K-Cups!  And I'm glad it is so inexpensive!
1,This candle sucks!,"This candle does not work at all. As strong as the smell is you would think it would be the best bug repellent ever, but its not. I have two mosquito bites on my leg to prove it and the darn thing was less than 5 feet away from me!"
1,Yuck!,This soup tastes terrible and looks like hamster food mixed with water.  I would never recommend this to anybody.  I'm very disappointed.
4,"I love this tea, but I won't buy it here.",Come on 28.00 for shipping.  That's more than the tea cost.  How ridiculous!
5,utahsand,"ohh boy oberto it is fresh jerky when it comes to your door with amazons awesome delivery service you will not be upset at all we have tried regular,pepper and the bbq pork flavor and there all great and rember jerky is a great source of protein"
3,Plenty,"I wish they would have given the amount of cinnamon sticks that were in the bag, because I bought 2 not knowing if 1 was enough, and I didn't even go through 1 bag!  There were easily over 100 cinnamon sticks in one bag"
5,A worthy and welcome replacement,"I don't know what has happened to formulation or processing of the ""big name"" Earl Grey teas in the past several years, but the quality of those had degraded to such an extent that I went looking for a replacement. I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a ""double bergamot"" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try."
5,Awesomely Delicious,"We love this Carmel Apple Cider.  We are customers for life.  It is so light, not a lot of calories and very delicious."
5,A Touch of Elegance,"It's absolutely amazing how adding a simple dab of sugar can make a cupcake pop! The thing about this product is its vibrance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would. After all what do you have to lose, the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store."
5,Zukes is great,"Zuke's training treats are made with excellent ingredients, none of the crap I eat for myself. The small size allows me to give my golden more of them than a bigger size."
5,Food Markers Rock!,"These are the first food markers that I have purchased, but they work exactly like you would expect. The tip was defined enough for me to easily write numbers and provide a nice deep black color. I was using it to make tick marks on a fondant tape measure for a sewing themed cake. While this was the simplest component of the cake it easily provided for the biggest ""wow"" factor with people. I would highly recommend these to people getting stated in cake/cookie decorating as it opens up lots of new possibilities."
5,Amazon's Lowrey' bacon curls,"This is an excellent product for curbing the appetite without the abundance of carbs.  They are crisp, fresh and great tasting.  Since I started eating these pork rinds, I dropped some unnecessary pounds."
5,Great Tasting Stuff,This made the best pecan pie ever.  Not just sweet like corn syrup. Actually adds a great flavor to the pie.
5,Wow ... this is a lot of almonds,Got them today.  All seem to be great mature natural almonds.  They are not salted or flavored so should be a healthy snack.  I didn't realize how many there would be.  I poured them into sealable containers because they are going to be around for a while.
3,Just okay,"These are just okay. As cookies go, the taste is nothing special nor that unique. While they certainly are not bad, I will likely not be purchasing these in the future."
1,I was so hopeful,"I read the reviews and was so hopeful. Im sorry but this coffee was nasty from the first wiff. Smelled like old, stale canned coffee. Tasted like the worst coffee at Dennys that you would have to force yourself to drink to be polite. Maybe I got a bad batch but unfortunately I have 32 oz of this unreturnable product."
5,Positively delicious!,"Add a little of this syrup to ice water and you get a fantastic refreshing drink in the summer.  Incidentally, the 0% sugar version is just as delicious!  Growing up in France, I spent many afternoons sitting at cafes sipping this mint drink.  35 years later, it's still as wonderful!"
4,A good blend,This coffee has me looking forward to my breakfast coffee.<br />I've been able to get two good cups out of each pouch<br />on my single cut maker.<br />The resulting coffee isn't as oily as some blends that I have tried<br />recently. I'm enjoying this box while I can.<br />My local store doesn't stock these specialty brands.
5,The Best Mayonaise!,"This is the very best mayonaise on the market. It tastes exactly like homemade mayonaise! I had never had ""bought mayonaise"" until I was in high school, as my Mother always made it at home. I also never dreamed how hard it is to make, keeping the perfect drop by drop of the oil, steady, constantly beating it into the beaten egg yolks, salt,pepper, dry mustard-then gradually adding the lemon juice, then in a nano second-it goes bad--and you have to start all over! Dukes gives me my Mom's mayonaise in all its creamy, tart, glory--Thank you, Dukes!"
1,Very dry,These cookies are extremely dry. They are to the point of being non edible. Total waste of money. Would never buy or recommend to anyone. I will have to stay with the ones I purchase at Sam's Club.
5,This stuff is delicious,"I LOVE THIS STUFF. Really, I do. I have tried all of the flavors, but I haven't tried the original. I have to say, by far, pineapple is my favorite. Guava is a close second. Who am I kidding? I love them all!<br /><br />Despite what others say about it tasting best at room temperature, I find it tastes very refreshing and even better when on ice. If you want a natural, tasty alternative to water, this is for you."
1,All of them came broken!!!,"I bought six can of these wafers and all the wafers were smashed!!!, what a pity!. It is most the cost to return them, that I just put them on the trash. AMAZON SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WHEN SELLING and PACKING THIS TYPE OF ITEM, THIS ARE VERY FRAGIL, SO WHEN I OPENED THE BOX THEY WERE NOT WELL PACKED. I am so disappointed because I wasted my money."
1,too expensive,Overpriced! I was shocked when I went into Walmart and purchased this exact same litter for $16<br />Never buying this product off amazon again
5,Great Alternative to Coffee,"I am a certified coffee-holic!  I have recently taken to ""clean-eating"" which eliminates all processed foods and frowns on caffeine.  I was a bit panicked about giving up my coffee habit but found the Teeccino herbal coffee (chocolate mint is my favorite) to be a great alternative.  I haven't given up the caffeine completely but I have reduced it by more than half and I'm sleeping a lot better.  The other good news is that I lost over 50 pounds cutting down on the cafeeine and eating clean so  I am now at a healthy weight."
5,Yummy and Cute!,"Have purchased these a few times - they are always well packaged, fresh with a nice flavor and they are adorable!  Highly recommend!"
1,Teavana,Teavana messed my order up sending it to the wrong address -- it was supposed to be a present.  Never again will I buy online from Teavana
5,Dog's VERY happy with them,"Amazon offered this brand after Merricks hadn't been available for a considerable time; Merrick's pricing began to be way out of line as well. I tried these, found them to be affordable and of superior quality.  Have already re-ordered them - had instructions from my Golden not to EVER run out again.  As usual, Amazon came through for me - I truly appreciate their fine service."
5,My favorite coffees,"I have ordered the coffees i enjoy most in packs of 50, the cost and taste of the Gloria Jean is my favorites so far.. They are a real bargain at a great price!!!"
5,Great value for a good quality jerky,"Great item to do Sub & Save on so you can keep a healthy snack on hand for work, school or just at home. Teriyaki is my personal favorite."
4,"Odd, but I like them","These definitely have a cakey, chalky like texture, but they taste really good.  The chocolate taste is really good without having the weirdness that some diet bars have.  You can tell there are chocolate chips throughout them too.  I usually can't control myself once I start eating cookies and things like that,  but even though these are small, just one takes care of my craving for something sweet.  I'd say give them a try."
5,Kavli crackers are an important part of my diet,"I discovered the Kavli thin crackers in paris at ""Marks & Spencer"" in 1980 and Kavli has been since, ""my bread"" and I was happy, when we moved to the US in 1987, to find them also here.<br /><br />I can say that kavli has been an important part of helping me to keep my weight"
5,non-diet 'diet food',I have been enjoying Healthy Choice healthy mixers but decided to try thisand did not realize that it was already cooked (no need to add water and cook for 3:30 like the healthy mixers. It has 320 calories and 5g of fat and although it is not marketed as 'diet' or 'healthy' it is inline nutritionally with them. Maybe it is just the shape of the container but it feels like more food too.<br />I don't like spicy food per se but this has a tiny kick to it- nothing crazy spicy.<br />It cooks in 60sec which is awesome too. The pasta may have a slightly more 'dense' (not dente)feel to it if that makes sense but really tastes very fresh. Hope amazon stocks these soon! I found them at my local grocery store but was hoping amazon had them in their subscribe & save offerings...
4,Great for traveling,"I brought them for my trip to Europe. The hotels in Europe usually have a kettle, but only instant coffee power. It was wonderful to be able to have a real cup of coffee in my room! It's also organic.<br /><br />I would prefer it to be a bit stronger, but over all this is a great product for traveling and camping. I'll definitely buy them again."
5,A Work of Art,"The box containing Marley Coffee Single Serve Pods is exquisite -- a work of art. The description of the product is fascinating. There is one little problem though. Nowhere on the package or on the individual packets can I find instructions as to the way to use the product. I determined that information by experimentation.<br /><br />The square packets inside are also works of art. There is only one little problem with them: the absence of a notch in the edge to make it easy to tear the packet open. When I manage to open  a packet with a knife, the aroma takes me away. Every time I open one, the marvelous flavor makes me rush to make the coffee, which is as good as it smells."
1,dirtj,sent it back.the top corner of lid was coming off.i dont no who gets the 1 star.i would order again.but found some
5,Always in the pantry.,I love this stuff. I serve it with curry and eat it on crackers and biscuits for a treat :). I always have it on hand.
1,Tastes like a Garbage Disposal,Let me begin by saying I really like most of the flavors of V8 Fusion juice that I have tried. This one is absolutely HORRIBLE. It tastes like a rotten garbage disposal. I brought 6 of the bottles to my office and everyone that took one home agreed that it was awful. I poured the rest out. Get any flavor but this one.
5,Enjoyable,"I only learned about toasted pumpkin seed oil recently, but it has already become a favorite food. I have tried other brands, but this is the best so far. It has a complex aroma of toasted nuts, and goes as well with oatmeal or vanilla ice cream as with a salad. A word of caution: this oil is fragile, and needs to be stored in the refrigerator after opening to preserve its flavors and aromas."
5,No Fuss - Great Taste,"This product is very easy to use and is ready in five minutes.  The hardest part of the process is cutting open the package.  Freeze dried beans in all flavors are far superior to canned.  They have the same great taste of homemade, are rich in flavor, fiber and ease of cooking"
3,"Ok snack, but I won't buy again","These pecans have a salty sweet glaze and are very rich. I usually have a hard time stopping when it comes to praline pecans, but I haven't felt compelled to open up a second bag in the same setting. The thick coating is pretty hard and my mouth is a little raw after eating a 2 ounce bag. The pecans are good quality but I did eat a few that had a slight bitter taste. I prefer an off brand praline pecan at one of my local stores. They use premium pecans with a perfect texture, lighter glaze but just as sweet and not salty. I decided to try these pecans because the other brand is 10.99 at full price for just 10 ounces. Once I finish these pralines I will be going back to the store brand."
5,"Great Anytime Baby, Toddler, Kid Snack","Absolutely love Ella's Kitchen pouches.  The sweet potato, pumpkin, apples and blueberry one is my 12mo son's favorite, although my 5yo loves it as well.  I wish I had discovered them sooner.  Squeeze into a bowl for spoon feeding or let your little one drink directly from the pouch.  They're convenient and healthy - highly recommend!"
3,my kitties didn't care for them,"I liked that these treats didn't have anything gross in them (i.e., corn, wheat, soy, by-products).  My cats don't really care for salmon, but i thought since it was mixed with turkey, which they love, they might like them. Well they didn't, they took one sniff and wanted nothing to do with them.  Though my inside cats didn't want them, the stray cats outside loved them."
4,the real stuff,"Other than the green ones tasting oddly like Pine-Sol, this is the best of the Salt-Water taffy currently found on Amazon.<br />Fralinger's sets the standard."
5,Tortillia Chips with flavor!,"These have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips.  Always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks. Top quality ingredients; brown rice, oat fiber, sunflower seeds etc. are what give this product the taste to start a conversation. Serve with fresh veggies and a good dip, always a crowd pleas-er!  I certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor."
5,Best Maple Syrup yet!,"Based on the other 2 reviews I chose to give this brand of syrup a try.  WOW, it has a deep, rich, buttery flavor and aroma.  My husband has been wanting pancakes just so he can eat the syrup! I've used it for a Master Cleanse and don't know if it's the quality of the syrup or what, but have had better success with detoxing using this than a Grade A or other brand of Grade B (this is my 3rd MC).  I look forward to using this for breakfast and baking, I will reorder again and recommend to friends and family! It would make a great gift in a gourmet gift basket!"
5,Fantastic,Nothing... and I mean absolutely nothing compares to these. Semi-hard chocolate shell outside and incredibly smooth chocolate inside. It's heaven in a box. Godiva DOESN'T EVEN COMPARE.<br /><br />The absolute best chocolate ever.
3,"Works, but a little bit tricky","By biggest complaint about this trap is that it is not all that easy to set, and the directions are vague.  Once set it works well and is easy to see even in tall grass, so you can tell from a distance if it has gone off."
1,sickly,"It;s far too sweet why do they make things too sugary??, bought as a 2 for 1 deal...  added cider vinegar to make it into a dressing still too sweet threw it away."
4,Second best canned sardines in the states.,I have lived in Spain. I have tried almost every brand of canned sardines in New York. I still like the ones from Spain. This one is pretty good although not as good as those available in Spain. Since I am here I have to settle with this brand. My complaint is that the fish is a little on the dry side.<br /><br />Goya has the best canned sardines in the states.
5,Delicious,Tastes great and is only 1 WW point!! I have to share with everyone in my office when I make it!
5,The water of paradise!,"Who says all water tastes the same? I can tell the difference while drinking this. This stuff is the best most crisp bottled water I've had. I like to try different bottled waters, such as VOSS, Fred, Smart, Evian, etc. But nothing seems to top Figi, this stuff is truely refreshing. Buy some now!"
5,Great product!,I bought two of those to freeze food for my baby and they are great.  The food pops out pretty easily.  I wish they were a little cheaper though.
3,powder core,These are very sour once you break open the gum .. inside is a sour powder that once disolved quickly loses its sourness.  you are left with little flavor gum.  Not bad for the price I guess and the sour is very intense for a very short burst. I just wish the gum itself had more flavor to last past the burst of sour that came from the inside of gumball.
4,Not Cheap - but seems to keep forever and arrives fast,"This price is about the same as most of the other cheese powder I order online ... but it comes in a sealed can.  So it will keep ""almost forever"" and tastes great."
5,SO disappointed they no longer are making this exact coffee!,"This beats every other Hazelnut k cup out there Now the company has changed the formula and are calling the new hazelnut ""vanilla hazelnut"". Its good, just ok but not as full bodied as this. If you get the chance (and I don't see it first) order the original. Its so worth it!"
1,"STALE AND CAN'T RETURN BECAUSE OF A ""NO-RETURN"" POLICY","I received this box of popcorn and ""STALE"" is an understatement.  The seller has a NON RETURN policy and I can't email them either.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY<br />RIP OFF<br /><br />POPCORN IS STALE AND THERE IS A ""NON-RETURN"" POLICY"
2,Over sweet and heavy on dried orange peel,"Robertson products are usually quite good, but this was disappointing.  Baked as is from the jar, there was little flavor other than orange peel.  There seems to be a lot of mashed up fig (or something seeded which resembles fig).  The product is overpoweringly sweet. Sugar is the first ingredient on the label - should have checked before buying!<br /><br />However, it makes a decent base.  Add two cups of diced tart apples, some brandy and a bit more cinnamon/nutmeg and it isn't bad for a quick mincemeat filling."
3,favorite 50 cent KCup is still elusive,"Am still searching for a 50 cent K-Cup with decent flavor. This particular Extra Bold K-Cup is ok but is not anything special. Looking for discounts is tedious and tiresome. Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count ""value"" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety."
4,Worked GREAT - White Woman w/ Blonde Hair,"I just got the product yesterday. I used it last night. I have fine blonde hair with damage from regular abuse. It is also thinning a little, due to the abuse. I put it on starting at roots, massaged into scalp and then ran it through the ends. It stunk. It was not the worst smelling product, but it was not nice. I left it on all night. The smell did not keep me awake. In the morning I washed it twice with a Nexus shampoo and ran a daily conditioner through my hair really quickly. It worked GREAT! My hair feels healthier. My ends show a little less damage, but really the only cure for split ends is a trim. It also looks really shiny. I plan on using this for about an 30 minutes to an hour 3 times a week for about a month then backing off to twice a week - I really don't want my hair to darken, so I might drop down to once a week, depending on how my hair reacts. I will use this product again and would advise anyone that is dealing with brittle, damaged, fine hair to use it as well."
5,Will order again,"This was my first product by San Francisco Bay, but won't be the last.  It works perfectly in the Keurig and the coffee is very good.  I'll continue to buy K-cups from this company."
1,Buffalo bills Jerky,I am unable to review this product.  My intended receipient never received this product.  I became warn down on tracking this as no contact info was provided.  Unhappy!
5,My dog loves these!,"I've tried many different types of ""natural"" biscuits for my dog that has allergies.  These are by far, his favorite!"
3,Muesli,"At first my son loves it but when he tried other baby food he doesn't like this anymore . I think it's the sourness of the apricot that he's not fond of. Earths best should sell a variety so it is easier for us,moms, to feed our children. I was worried that we had to throw about six jars."
5,Mixed spices make you a gourmet cook,"Not just for dipping, these spice mixtures add zest to meats, salads, mashed potatoes -- about anything edible you can name.  My only complaint is that I use them so often in so many different dishes, that I frequently run out -- so I've learned to buy in quantity."
3,"Decent, but a little odd","I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.<br /><br />I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more."
3,Great tea....short time before expiration date,"I love, love, love the tea!  It's really good with cream and sugar.  I bought three boxes (they all came as one order,) and the expiration date is three months from now:(  I like the tea, but thought the expiration date would be at least 6 months after I bought the tea."
5,excellent dog food,"After my dog has had wellness, she has more energy then before. I strongly recommend to people to buy it for your dog."
5,Liver Biscotti Dog Treats,Our dog really loves these treats & they are only 3 calories each!! They are quite expensive though & hard to find. It is much more economical to buy them in a 5 lb. bag. Product is great & my shipment came very quickly.
5,"A delicious candy, packaged super-conveniently","Boston Baked Beans are candy-coated peanuts. My favorite candy! There are 24 small boxes of these delicious ""beans,"" packaged in a larger box. Cute display punch-out for stores, or just for easy access to the beans. The small boxes make it easy to take a pack with you, so you can have them whenever you get a craving, and if you're like me, that happens a lot! Great value and quality. I will purchase, again."
5,The best way to a Arnold Palmer!,This is the best Arnold Palmer ever!  The tea is refreshing and brews perfectly!  Totally worth the expense!
3,"Tasty, but expensive and high-sodium","I purchased these hoping they would be a healthier alternative to the cheap Nissan/Maruchan 10 cent noodles you find everywhere. I've consumed literally hundreds of the Nissin/Maruchan, but stopped several years ago because they are just so ridiculously bad for you. I am a recovering addict - on some days I used to eat 6 packs! Make no mistake, these Myojo are healthier for you but they are NOT healthy. One serving has 120% of your DV of sodium (2900mg) and 6 grams of fat/2 grams of saturated fats, 68g of carbs (2g fiber). They also contain MSG in both the dry seasoning and liquid soupbase.<br /><br />Nutrition aside, I was anxious to try these to see how they compare to the cheap ramen. I have an aversion to anything seafood-related so I was dismayed to see the dry seasoning packet contains scallop and clam extract. HOWEVER, I was willing to give these a shot anyway. I cooked up the noodles for the suggested 4 minutes, and stirred in the dry seasoning and liquid (oil/soy sauce) packets. The seafood smell was too much for me - I had to dump it out and then mix it with one of the beef seasoning packets from the Maruchan noodles. As for the liquid packet - it adds a nice smokey, rich flavor to whatever seasoning you choose to use. The texture of the noodles is good and comparable to cheap ramen.<br /><br />The price of these is quite high. You might love the flavor of the seasonings and enjoy that they are not as fatty as cheap ramen, but ask yourself if these are worth up to 24 times the price. If they had lower sodium and less carbs, I could see these being worth it.<br /><br />My next ramen adventure is to try GreeNoodle without seasoning (ASIN: B0054S0P9E)."
5,Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."
5,Training Reward-High Protein and Non-greasy,"Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats are wonderful used as a reward during obedience training. For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time. There is no waste with this product. I have been using Pro-Treat for more than 15 years. The quality is excellent, and I found the best price to be on Amazon after doing a considerable amount of comparison shopping."
5,Luzianne Seafood Coating Mix is a winner,We absolutely love this powder coating mix for white type fish filets that we cook on the stove top in olive oil.  Not too spicey for us.  Just right.
5,Puff,This a wonderful treat.  my 3 Labs just love them.  very healthy and natural.  the small cubes are great for hiding in toys and a great mental challenge for the dogs  to figure out to get to the treats. I work in the animal field and every dog I have come across just gobbles them up. Just a few little cubes go a long way
4,yum - cheese!,"If you love your cheese puffs as I do - this is a great product. The first bite is strong, then addictive. I mean, you're not going to be getting blue cheese on your Cheetos! This is great tasting organic food!"
1,Terra Kettles sea salt krinkle cut potato chips,"I was disappointed, the chips were very oily and tasted and smelled rancid....Since they are supposedly high end snacks they do not live up to their billing."
5,Strawberry Flavor,Love this in my plain yogurt.  About a forth of a package flavors a lot.  Stevia is a favorite with me as a sweetener and so far I have not received any bad ill effects from this all natural diabetic friendly source of sweetener.  This strawberry flavor seems to do the trick at putting a little more taste in my yogurt.
5,the best green tea,"I first tasted this tea when I visited Okinawa.  The Japanese have all sorts of vending machines, everywhere!  This is such a tasty, earthy flavored tea.  I order by the case.  I used to order it directly from ItoEn, but Amazon is less expensive.  Thanks for carrying this product.  If you like this tea, try the green-jasmine, it's excellent also."
5,Best stevia chocolate yet!,"I have been testing various stevia-sweetened chocolate, looking for a brand or supplier that would provide a dark chocolate without all the sugar.<br /><br />This one is excellent! Very dark but smooth without being bitter and no weird stevia/metallic aftertaste. I will order again!<br /><br />By the way, if you are not a dark chocolate fan OR if you are still eating/using products that contain real sugar or other artificial sweeteners, you may not like this product. The sweet taste is different from sugar/AS!"
3,It was very yummy but very soft!,"I was really excited to get this Quaker Soft Baked Cookie in the Oatmeal raisin flavor because this is one of my favorite flavors. Over all the flavor was fabulous with just the right amount of raisins, but I found it to be toooo soft. I do like soft cookies but I had a hard time eating this cookie because it was so soft it crumbled in my fingertips as I tried to take bites so I had to eat it over the wrapper carefully. I also let my 7 year old son and my 12 year old daughter try bites and they loved it and did not care that it was soft and crumbly at all. Overall I would recommend trying them because the flavor is good and maybe they are not all that soft."
5,Awesome and Wonderful Nutiva Coconut Oil,I am so happy I purchased this item.  It was better than I expected and I will definitely order again.  The consistency was perfect and the taste heavenly.  I can cook with it and use it as a facial spa treatment.  What more could a girl want?
1,Worst smelling incense ever...,"I love the smell of lavender, it has a herbal and floral scent while still remaining masculine. I've used ""Yardley's of London Lavender Soap"" daily for years, I even use lavender fabric softener and washing detergent. And this incense smells good in the box... but when it's burnt it reminds me of the smell of a nursing home. You ever visited that old lady's apartment who sits by the window and smokes cigarettes? I have a great-aunt like that and her place has a very distinct smell... and that's exactly what ""HEM Precious Lavender"" smells like. It's just plain gross. Although I can see others may enjoy this scent, it's definitely a ""love or hate"" type thing. There's no middle ground here. One star because it has no redeeming value."
1,DIDNT GET ALL THEY PROMISED!,"DO NOT ORDER THESE!! Im EXTREMELY disappointed!! I was told I would get an assortment that included several varieties in the product description, and was only given HALF of what I was told I would get! They left out a LOT of the flavors I really wanted to try. I cant return this per the policy on this product which is stupid since its the fault of the packager (it was shipped to me in a brown bag...someone obviously puts them together, so its not prepackaged), and I cant apparently contact the seller either to tell them to make it right. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN!!!"
5,Use your bean.....,"....and buy Camellias when you're making Red Beans and Rice. As a New Orleans expatriate, I can verify that no other brand of bean produces the same results (ie, thick, creamy gravy) when you're trying to cook this dish. Simply sort (very few bad beans or dirt in this product), wash, soak overnight, then throw 'em in a pot with onions, celery, bay leaves, a little minced garlic and water (a pretty good recipe is printed right on the back of the packaging). Add salt, pepper, cayenne and tobasco to taste. If you like a heartier variety, throw in a hamhock, andoille sausage or some diced ham that's been browned in a skillet. Serve over rice. It's the Monday lunch and supper of choice in New Orleans for over a hundred years. The best buck-and-a-half food bargain there is......."
5,Extremely convenient,"I really appreciate being able to toss a packet into my diaper bag for going out.  Although I am breast-feeding, nothing is worse than a super hungry 3 month-old at a time when I cannot immediately feed him.  So, I carry a bottle and a pack of formula just in case.  I have also measured formula into ziploc baggies, but it is not nearly as easy to pour and is less convenient."
5,A little too lite for my taste,"Well let me say what I like, English Breakfast tea, High Mountain Oolong. This tea didn't have enough taste. I guess you get less caffeine but without taste what's the point of drinking tea? A very light fragrance as well.<br /><br />I like Teaspots Bolder Breakfast. Try that if you want more flavor."
4,Good for a K-cup,No K-cup is going to be as good as a brewed coffee unless you like it weak but this is pretty good.  A bold rating is a necessity on K-cups just to get medium strong coffee.  If you buy several at once (because free shipping is at the $60 level) 11th Street Coffee is a couple of bucks cheaper.  Coupon codes are also easy to find for them.
5,great nuts!,"I was concerned because a reviewer said there were bad nuts in her shipment, and I had bought a smaller bag of another brand that had some good and some bad nuts.  These are uniformly good (I opened one of the five pouches, but we have eaten about half of it without finding any problem).  No discolored nuts.  Very uniform, mostly whole.  Various sizes, but uniform good taste.  highly recommended.<br /><br />The only cons are the very high caloric content (I cut them with almonds), and the price, although this was the best price I found."
5,Great Deal!,"When I was in Alaska, I ""discovered"" smoked salmon in a can.  Up until then I would have to buy smoke salmon ""on a slab"" and it is always expensive.<br />When I got home I tried to find the canned version, which I did, but most websites that had it were charging ridiculous prices. Pike Place brand is excellent, well-priced and I can store it for months-It is ready ""to go"" as needed.-I use it in a smoked salmon pate or just mix with cream cheese and serve with bagels.-Probably not as good as the ""slab"" for serving ""as is"", but I have not tried it that way, so I am not sure?<br />Also, was eligible for ""free-Shipping"" through ""Amazon""-an addtional perk!"
5,"My toddler still loves these now that he's a ""big boy""!","I started using these when my son was about 10 months old and stuck with them because they're organic, they have actual greens in them (amazing!) and HE LOVES THEM! Now that he's 2, he still asks for them. Who am I to argue?"
1,Tastes like VitaCACA!,"We bought about 10 different brands of coconut waters and compared them all.  This one was one of the worst tasting brands ever!  Try this brand, it tastes the closest to the real thing!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OVWQDA"">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>"
5,Delicious,"I only tried this tea because it was provided free at my hotel in Oregon. That was a few years ago and I have been drinking this tasty tea ever since. You can add sugar if you want and it's good, but what I really love about this tea is that it is delicious with nothing added. Nothing's needed. Tea bag, hot water, steep, done, drink. Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste."
5,"Perfect biscuits, perfectly intact","My local grocery store no longer sells McVitie's so I was overjoyed to find I could order in bulk here! As you can see from the photo I added, they come wrapped in multiple layers of air and boxes. No breakage - I got 7 packs of perfect biscuits just in time for wintertime heavy tea drinking!"
5,Very good noodles,"My whole family loved these noodles.  My kids did notice a difference between these and their standard Ramen noodles, but they said they liked them and ate the whole bowl.  Will buy again."
5,Finally a safe way to regulate!,This is the best product I've found to keep my digestion regular.  It is a nice way to flavor your water and sip across the day.  The rasp-lemon flavor is best!
5,LOVE this tea!,I absolutely love licorice and I love this tea. I have a glass nearly every night in the winter. It tastes great and settles your stomach.  Highly recommend.
5,Good crackers,"Good cackers! Can't get them at our groacery store any more, hsve to order tham online."
1,Soda Stream My Water Flavor Essence,The glass bottles came in a flimsy bubble-lined envelope.<br /> One of the bottles arrived broken!<br />They should have come in a box with extra packaging.<br />I was very unhappy and will NOT order the product through Amazon again.
3,Great.... but,Love the product -my dogs did very well on it. Would have continued to purchase more. But cannot afford it at the enormous increase in price
3,there ok,not as sour as i was hoping. I was hoping for some really sour rope instead I got a sugary rope that taste pretty old. I dont know if I got an old batch but they are not sour and the candy it self was pretty hard. Over all I would stay away if your looking for some thing sour.
5,LOOOOVE IT!,"I love this stuff!!! Unfortunately, in order to watch my mid-section, I don't drink it a lot. In fact, my 13 oz. jar has a date on the bottom ""11 OCT 2001"".  Somehow I just never thought this stuff could actually expire. I mean, it's just powered malted stuff... what do I know."
5,Easiest Popcorn for a Crowd!,I work at the public library and we have family movie programs on a regular basis. There could be anywhere from 10 to 60 people watching the movie and I need to have the popcorn ready at a steady pace. We have one of the big popcorn machines on a cart and use Great Northern Popcorn's 8 ounce packs. The popcorn tastes great and the packaging is perfect for our needs.
5,"love it, love it, love it!","I was looking for something that would satisfy my iced mocha craving each morning but with a healthier twist.  Enter Click espresso drinks!  In place of my breakfast and iced coffee I now have a Click mocha espresso.  I make mine with half milk & half water.  I also bought a shaker cup to mix it & it works great, tastes great and is actually healthy!  I love it so much I signed up for the automatic delivery each month (2 canisters) where you save an additional 15% through Amazon :)"
3,Puroast Low Acid Coffee,"I have tried many coffees, but never a low acid one.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  The aroma of the coffee after brewing was fine, but I felt that it tasted strong like a certain brand from Seattle.  And I don't like their coffee. For a dark French roast it tasted burnt to me.  On the other hand, my wife enjoyed it (and she is big fan of DD coffee).  I guess it goes to what each individual's taste is but to me this wasn't my cup of tea (pun intended)."
5,Steak Dust,"We were trying to find Grill-Creations Steak Dust made by Durkee's and found Amazon.com had something called Durkee Steak Dust. It looked the same as what we had purchase at the store but I wanted to make sure so I emailed there customer service about it and sure enough they emailed me back to verify that it was the same product.My husband puts this on everything we grill,its the best tasting steak dust we ever had and the price is fanstastic..."
5,Great Flavor!,"Many moons ago I was a nanny for a Korean family in the midwest (I am not Korean).  The kids were a delight and so was the freshly prepared, culturally authentic food.  These chili flakes are a tasty addition to the Korean dishes prepared in my home.  Enjoy!"
5,Best Olive Oil Ever!,"I get this at the Sacramento Farmer's Markets, but my dad moved to Colorado and really missed the California Olive Oils. I sent him a bottle of this oil and he was in heaven! It has a strong taste of olives, cloudy, and even olive 'dust' on the bottom - To me, this is a sign of quality you can NEVER get at a grocery store! This oil is best for pesto, dipping bread, and fresher meals--as the taste diminishes with cooking. As a 'foodie', I have never found a better oil! Thank you!"
5,The best fish sauce ever!,"I was raised on this brand of fish sauce. To me, Tiparos is the greatest brand. You can't get any better than this. Add a couple squirts to raw eggs, then scramble them in a pan, and eat with fresh, hot, white rice. That's quick and delicious. We use fish sauce to cook all of our Thai meals and marinate beef and chicken for various dishes. For me, there is no other."
2,Item I ordered arrived as a totally different brand,"As I live in Croatia and could not order the coffee to my address, I used a US address and had the coffee shipped to me by US mail.<br />I was shocked when a totally different brand name arrived, and not Kahlua coffee. The only thing was that it was the flavor I ordered but some other brand of coffee. I can not help but wonder if I had overpaid and why Amazon would send something completely different."
5,Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.,"Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them."
4,Vienna Blend is wonderful!,"The Vienna blend is a wonderful smooth rich blend,<br />we love this blend as well as Toscana, and Reserve. The pods work great in our Senseo.<br />But we are very dissappointed with Amazon that they discontinued<br />it from their subscription plan which made it very affordable. We have been getting all our Puck Pods from Amazon for quite a while on the subscription plan which saves us considerable in cost.<br />We will be getting this as well as our other Puck favorite Pod<br />blends from [...] from now on. They offer the next best price ($1 more per box) and free shipping over $50."
1,Nastiest Thing EVER,"I tried this hoping for a good substitute for peanut butter, because I am truly addicted to it, which means no weight loss for me.  It was absolutely horrible.  I couldn't even get down one spoonful of the stuff, even when I tried spreading it on some bread.  Just awful!  Ewwwwwwwwww."
5,Wonderful and Healthy Chocolate,"First off, I have to admit the guy who thought it actually contained bat and wrote a review is hilarious. Read it if you are looking for a laugh. Otherwise, considering this chocolate is supporting an endangered species of animal the manufacturing is amazing! This is the best dark chocolate I have ever had. And the nutrition facts aren't that bad either considering this is candy."
4,Best keurig coffee for Starbucks fans,"We have a Krupa 9000 that is in storage so we had to find good coffee for the kuerig. This is the best we could find, not Starbucks but close enough to tie us over."
5,I love this stuff!,"And so does my grandson Mr Picky!<br /><br />Easy to use, although a little sizable to tote around.<br /><br />Good fruit flavor, no after taste.<br />Mixes very easily in (dull, boring, plain) water.<br /><br />I keep mine at work, assuring I drink more water!  It works.<br /><br />As far as the energy value, I'm really not sure.<br /><br />I plan to continue to buy this product.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF"
3,I don't know how to describe this...,"But, I will do the best I can.<br /><br />In all honesty, I didn't expect too much from this, but again, I've never tasted coconut milk or coconut ""water"" as it were.  I've never even tasted natural coconut.  So I go into this review in complete ignorance of what to expect.<br /><br />First negative: The sampler I received was already a day past the ""best before"" date.  Way to go Amazon!  (yes, I know, it's still 'good' for a few days after, but I'm a real stickler for freshness...especially for something I've never had before.)<br /><br />Second negative: The taste.  It's not bad...it's just not good.  If I had to describe it...you know how bananas taste, right?  You know the texture of the banana, especially those little slivers that come off the skin, is a little powdery after you've eaten for a while?  Take that texture, remove the banana flavor, mix it in water, and you've got this.  Or extremely watered down milk.  I just can't see this really refreshing anyone, because there's no ""kick"" to it.<br /><br />So what's good about it?  Well, it's natural.  I give it kudos for that, because there are a lot of non-natural beverages out in the world making us sick.<br /><br />""That's it????""  I mean, what more can I really say about it?  The taste is horrendous, I wasn't refreshed after drinking it, I can't imagine buying this in the store, etc etc.  Sorry I can't put more words to this review, but the above summarizes my reaction as best I can."
1,Not Good,"I ordered this based on what the flavor was, but i got it and ground the beans and it didn't smell or taste anything like what the flavor says it should.  Will not order it again"
5,Professional cyclist,My husband was a pro cyclist and swears by Cytomzx it is always his drink of choice for long rides.
4,Helped Spouse That Has Fibromyalgia,"I originally purchased Natural Calm to help with my own insomnia and anxiety issues. I started out with 1/2 teaspoon and gradually worked up to 1 teaspoon taken before bedtime. If I take more than 1 teaspoon, it has a laxative effect the next day. Even though it does help me relax, it doesn't really help with the insomnia. I've recently switched to Slow-Mag for a more sustained release of magnesium throughout the day. It doesn't have the same laxative effect, plus helps with daytime anxiety. However, my spouse (who has fibromyalgia) has had positive results with Natural Calm. It has improved his quality of sleep and also helped with muscle aches and overall fatigue. He takes about 1 to 1/2 teaspoons each night. I anticipate that he will want to continue purchasing Natural Calm. It doesn't work the same for everyone, but we are very happy with how the product has helped him so far."
5,Surprisingly Good,"Hontesly, I thought when I had to buy six packages what if I don't like this.  But it is wonderful.  It tastes and has the texture of regular pasta.  A low carb ready made that is good."
5,Guilt Free Pleasure,"I've tried lots of different cappuccino mixes and by far and away this is my favorite! I like that it's sugar free and has no trans fats so I can enjoy it without feeling like I'm going to have to slog through extra long workouts or that I'm hopelessly clogging my arteries.<br /><br />I have a fairly large mug and I make it using two mounded teaspoons of Cafe D'vita Sugar Free Mocha, 2 scant tablespoons of fat free coffee creamer and about 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee. Very satisfying. I drink it almost every day and don't have to feel guilty if I have more than one cup in a day."
5,"Xlear XyloSweet Xylitol Sweetener, 3lb bag",no after taste and use it for every thing that needs regular sugar  and it taste good. I am diabetic so I am happy that I have found this wonderful product.
5,Great product,"I don't eat oatmeal regardless of how good it is for you. This is my breakfast now, it's sweet and nutty. Takes 90 seconds and is perfectly cooked every time. I'm so glad I found this product."
4,Pretty good,"I found this coffee to have a nice smooth flavor with not a whole lot of bitterness. The only complaint I really have is that these premeasured packets are supposed to be a perfect measure of coffee for the Ekojava reusable k-cup. However, there seems to be too much coffee in these packets. If I try using the entire packet it seems to bog down my Cuisinart Keurig brewer and sometimes bogs it down so much that it will not even make a full cup of coffee. I have found that by using most but not all of the coffee in the packet that it seems to brew much easier."
4,yummy,thought this was creamy with a nice chocolate taste.  Would probably splurge and purchase again.<br />Better than the usual Swiss Miss taste!
5,Lucky Country  Licorice rocks!,"Lucky Country Licorice, Black, is the most like old fashioned black licorice that we've found.  We were very disappointed to find it was no longer available in the Costco stores where we shop."
3,Not Great,"Packages were inconsistent. Some were good, some were sub par. I would not buy again. Also I was not pleased that I had to buy so many at once."
5,Earthy and comforting,"Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy. I love it! his will definitely be a repeat order."
5,Perfect springtime tea,"Ahh the taste of cherries in the spring, and the smell too.  When this arrived today I was eager to brew my first cup.  The contemplation this prompts in me is such a joy."
2,Super fake,"This is one of those cereals where the ""fruit"" is a mix of 99% grain and chemicals, and 1% extracted fruit juice. If you want a really natural cereal, or one where the fruits don't taste disgusting, look elsewhere."
5,Nice Jasmine Tea,This is a very good Jasmine tea. It is fragrant and a very smooth flavor. It is as described by Allegro. I like this tea a lot.
5,Great iced coffee,I love iced coffee so I decided to give this a try.  Its not too sweet or too bitter.  Very good back-up when I'm running late for work and unable to stop for my iced coffee at the coffee shop!
4,cherry review,"My family has gotten these cherries for a couple of years now on Amazon. They are SO good. They can give you gas if you eat too many at once tho- so be aware! :)  But they are so flavorful and the deal is a breaker, better here than the home site. So fret not- buy!"
1,"Really, really sandy","I'm sorry to say that I tried the Lemon flavored cookie, and it tasted like someone had taken beach sand, flavored it with a little lemon juice and sweetener, added a teaspoon of water, packed it together, and sold it as a cookie. It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart. It was like when you're building a sand castle and the sand isn't wet enough... it doesn't hold together. I couldn't finish it."
5,Keeps me going,Just started grad school two months ago and I swear I've never drank so much red bull as I have these past two months. On top of school I have a 1.5 hr commute to and from school so this really helps keep me alert. Just make sure you accomplish what you really need to do when you first drink it. Sometimes I put my work off a little bit and find myself ready for a nap or an advil after the red bull has worn off.
5,Caribou Coffee,Caribou Coffee is an outstanding choice for K Cup lovers. It comes in a variety of flavors and is the perfect start for any morning.
5,My baby loves it!,"My baby boy does not like the taste of regular formula and simply refuses the bottle when I try to give it to him.  When I gave him Babys Only he was hesitant for a minute and then drank the whole bottle without stopping for breaks.  He likes it so much better than Similac and Good Start.<br /><br />The cost is comparative to the other brands, but the shipping adds up.  I didn't see it at the BabysRUs, still have to check the health food stores."
4,bob marley really does help me sleep!,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CT1NCY"">12 Pack of Marley's Mellow Mood - Black Tea Peach Raspberry Passion Fruit</a>I bought this on a whim, in a particularly bad walmart visit.  I was really surprised that after a few sips I was really not so bothered as i thought.  When I got home, I was reading the bottle, saw that it was quite natural ingredients, so since I never sleep for than 3-4 hrs. I bought a case at amazon.  Have used it off and on all month especially when I was upset and not sleeping, the calming affect helps me get back to sleep.  sandy in Central NY"
1,uuggghh!,"I remember enjoying campbells manhatten clam chowder when there were clams in it. This current soup had a few little flecks of clams and the rest was a thickened tomato base with mostly potatoes.Oh well,one more product to avoid. With the recent increase in food prices this is not worth one star!"
5,Beware,I love Chiclets. Too bad the manufacturer may have blown it by using a new rubbery gum base that renders it almost impossible to chew after a couple of minutes.  Yet another fine product down the drain due to what is likely to be cost cutting..
4,Very close to the real thing,"I really like the Cheddar, and the Cinnamon flavors.  If not for the expense, and the excessive use of shipping materials (necessary so that the chips don't all break), I'd order and eat these more often."
1,Not for me.,"I chose a cherry flavor to test, because I like cherry tasting candy and beverages. I came home from work today tired, thirsty and ready for a break. I was happy to find The switch had arrived, and it was already nice and cold since it is a really cold day.<br /><br />I sat down with my laptop and my switch ready to take a break. I took a nice long drink and found that this tasted nothing like black cherry to me. I reminds me more of Robitussin cough medicine. Another flavor might be more tasty, but I won't be purchasing this product for myself. I will stick to the much for refreshing and flavorful IZZE beverage."
4,Flavorful canned Cappuccino - only 100 calories,"I am an infrequent coffee drinker, but I do occasionally like a sweetened iced coffee or a mocha-flavored cappuccino. This canned cappuccino drink caught my eye and after tasting it, I was pleased at the taste. The coffee is flavorful, but not bitter. The drink has a great blend of coffee and chocolate flavors. The ingredients list sugar, but the whole can (8.45 oz.) has only 100 calories. Of course it's not a good as a fresh mocha cappuccino, but for a canned drink, it tastes great and is a good way to start the morning."
5,Cytomax is Great when the Heat Hits,"Here in Louisiana, we get hot during the summer. I started taking Cytomax about 10 years ago when I was preparing for a 100 mile ride. I trained for months riding longer and longer distances but would deplete my bodies energy. I would just run out of gas and cramp. With Cytomax, I was able to extend my miles without cramping. Because of the expense, I tried many other brands but for my body, Cytomax was the best."
5,Exact popcorn from the movies-Nothing else needed!,"I bought this in the 6 ounce when Amazon offered it for my 6 ounce machine.  Anyway this comes with the popcorn, oil and the salt flavoring which includes Flavacol (that secret movie theater ingredient).  I also bought extra butter topping and salt but that was a waste of money because this popcorn kit is all you need.  Any more salt is too much and the butter is perfect.  After I made it no one wanted anything extra on theirs and said it was perfect.  Also follow the directions on the popcorn package and not your machine to get the most kernels popped.  I know my 6 ounce in this popcorn made 7 small square boxes of popcorn so this makes more than that but keep in mind this popcorn tastes awesome cold too.  Keep it in a cool area so the oil side does not melt (easier to handle not messy).  It seems the first 1/3 that pops is the most buttery so after it all pops stir it up in your machine to even that out.  You will love this product if you want that perfect movie theater popcorn that is yellow, buttery, salty and flavorful.  No need to buy anything else.  I did a lot of searching on the internet to find ""that"" taste and now that I found it I wanted to share it with you to save you time and worry if you are getting the right thing.  So enjoy."
5,Great product,My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she's eating something thats good for her.
5,So FREAKIN GOOD!!,This was a gerat buy .. and cheapest I could find on the web.  Was delivered on time and was the hit of the party.  I will be ordering this again!!
5,Yummy,I just love Terra Chips. They are great for those of us who are looking for a healthy alternative to regular chips.
5,LOOOOVE these almonds!,"I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot. But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the ""bold"" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!"
5,Great Taste,"I've purchased the lemon, raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all. What I like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet--perfect for my taste."
5,Add a little seasoning,"Like most McDougalls soups, they are convenient but need a little seasoning. I always add a squirt of Braggs Liquid and a little hot sauce."
5,Yum!!,"Nabisco has always been one of my favorite brands, and these Honey Grahams are one of my favorite cookie/crackers. These still have the same fresh, crispy, and wonderful flavor, but the size and packaging is different.<br /><br />I like that these are packaged in 2""x4"" individual packs. They are great for lunchboxes, office desk, or just a quick snack. I like them at work with a cup of hot tea, and sometimes when I don't have time for a real lunch, they are great with peanut butter or Nutella - just excellent!<br /><br />There are 6 ""fresh stacks"" per box, and each one is considered 2 servings, so that is the only thing one needs to be careful of. It is too easy to open and eat one entire snack pack, which is 250 calories, so be careful to watch how any you eat at once or just share a pack!"
5,"Good , Great gift and good taste","You only get the kings. round up, victory and stallion names not the other<br />Great product<br />Got here in 4 or 5 days less than what estimation was<br />Very happy with the candy<br />Not a lot of the sticks were broken about 1 or 2 per pack<br />also the pricing was hella amazing"
4,more than soup,"I've enjoyed this product for many years now. Not only for the ease of soup, but also put it over pasta and sprinkle with grated cheese. Also into mashed potatoes.Also great on a long car ride. A thermos of hot water and your all set. Hits the spot Don't hesitate to enjoy this Cup-a-Soup."
5,Excellent basic espresso,"While there are lots of small coffee roasters whose espressos I enjoy, this is truly a good basic everyday espresso.  Espressos should be dark and full bodied. This one is rich and flavorful.  It makes a nice crema.<br /><br />It is also good for using in a countertop espresso machine. We have a Jura Capressa E8 Super Automatic.  A lot of the flavored coffees and roasts that are too dark gum up the system and make it sluggish.  And while it is not a big deal to change the grinder, it is probably better to use a bean the machine likes."
1,What a disappointment,"I love my Keurig, and I love most of the Keurig coffees.  This is instant coffee with instant milk and far too much sugar.  I don't know anyone I dislike enough to dump the rest of the box on."
5,You really go when taken as directed.,Works great for me and also help me with my weight.  I don't like the drink as much but I drink it as needed.
5,"A great product, but it is DEADLY to dogs and people need to be careful with it!!!","I personally love Xylitol - I have no digestive ill effects from it at all, though I do from many other sugar alcohols. I think a lot of that depends on your own personal body chemistry, so if you need a sugar replacement you should try a lot of small amounts of the different sugar alcohols. For me, maltitol and sorbitol are awful, but xylitol is just fine. Of all the sugar replacements I have tried, I think xylitol tastes the most like sugar. It has a nice, grainy texture like sugar does, which makes it appealing for applications like sprinkling it on fruit, and it isn't overly-sweet the way I find most sugar replacements are. If anything, I would say measure for measure it is slightly less sweet than sugar, which I actually like as I'm trying to reduce my sweet tooth in general.<br /><br />HOWEVER, EVERYONE WHO OWNS A DOG NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT XYLITOL IS DEADLY TO DOGS. I am not some weirdo posting rumors - please google xylitol dogs and the very first entry is from Snopes.com stating that this is true. As little as 3 grams can kill a 65 pound dog.<br /><br />I still use XyloSweet all the time; I am just very, very careful when I use it when my dog is around because he's a floor-licking sort of guy. And while I never give him people-food, I know others often do and you obviously can't do that with anything you've made with Xylitol.<br /><br />Please, please upvote this review if you can - I'm concerned that no warning appears on the bag or in the company's copy and that none of the highly-voted reviews discuss this issue. It is very easy to prevent what could be a deadly accident for your dog!"
5,Tasty Chips,Once you pop one in your mouth...you can tell these ain't Doritos and that it is a quality product...now the secret is to buy em on sale...
1,ham attric,way to saltee and would not take it back because of amazo will never buy at amazon againthat all ok nont order unless you like salt
5,dont need a crust to make this a great dessert,avoiding gluten these days...so decided to just make up the filling and fill the pie tin and a small bowl with it and cook it up in oven...its now my favorite dessert..toss a lil Reddi wip on it after its cooked and cooled and a dessrt is born
5,A LIGHT version of an amazing salad dressing,This is the Light version of Wafu Original (toasted sesame).  It's equally as delicious as the original even though it has 43% less fat.  A fantastic alternative if you're counting calories.
1,Lavazza must've changed their roasting technique,"I had bought this via Amazon's subscribe and save since (1) I have had previous great experiences with Lavazza, (2) the price was great on Amazon and (3) I wanted to try a product that was advertised as ""Low Caffeine"".<br /><br />The coffee was sour.  My espresso machine had a very hard time creating a nice creama.  Did I mention the coffee was sour???<br /><br />I've cancelled my subscription."
3,HMMM I hope its good!,I bought the REGULAR unleaded Emerils Big Easy Bold 18pack to try and after 1 cup I was bouncing off the walls.<br /><br />I think I need the DECAF.<br /><br />with enough french vanilla coffeemate and splenda its just like a real New Orleans Cafe Dumonde Cafe au-lait<br /><br />Ok pass the beignets please!
4,salty snack!,a little salty but great for when you are craving something like popcorn or chips!
5,It Works,"I really like the 5 hr Energy because it has no caffeine, no sugar and it works.  I like the fact that it has vitamins in it.  It helps get me over the last few hours of work when I start feeling sluggish."
4,Good Soup,I have been eating this soup for several years. It is very good and I like the Tomato as well.
1,Why so EXPENSIVE?????????,"Why are these so EXPENSIVE on here????  I have been buying these exact bars at Walmart in a 5 pk for $5.50 a box for the last 3 yrs.<br />That comes to $22.00 for the same amount you are charging 50 something for.<br /><br />These bars are by far my favorite Atkins bars, tastes much like a Snickers, but this price is REDICULOUS!!!!"
5,My Dog Likes It!,"I have an eight pound Chihuahua/Rat Terrier mix who will be eight years old this year.  I've tried many different kinds of dog food for her to no avail...and then there was Chef Michael's.  I finally found a dog food that she likes.  I mix one cup of Chef Michael's with 1/6th of Beneful Prepared Meals and she eats every bite.  My only problem with Chef Michael's is that it is hard to find in my area.  I would have to drive over 100 miles (round trip) to buy it so I order it thru Amazon.com, I'm a Prime member so shipping is free, and I get it in a couple of days.  If your dog is a fussy eater, try Chef Michael's.  I highly recommend it."
5,Too good,I have tried about every low calorie snack. These are so good I almost do not believe they have only 100 calories. They are  dense dark chocolate. If you are used to super sweet light chocolate you may not like these. I would eat these even if I were not counting calories.  I just subscribed for 2 cases every month and get a discount this way. And they are compact so great for traveling. Only bummer: need scissors to open package.<br />Addendum: A couple of months later I stopped my automatic deliveries of these brownies because they were too good.  I could not stop at one which defeats the purpose of a 100 calorie snack.  I find it is easier not to have the first one that to stop after one.
5,a great alternative to the standard Crystal Light flavors,"Don't know what I was expecting when I ordered this...I am not a drinker, so I don't know what an ""Appletini"" is or what it tastes like, but I do know that I like the flavor of green apple...so...<br /><br />...and it was a pleasant surprise! Refreshing, nice flavor...subtle, not too overpowering...and unlike the other reviewers, I found it to be wonderful very cold or even just room temperature...and of course, the price was right!"
5,The dogs rate these treats at 5 big slurpy kisses!!,"These two dogs, Red & Zazu, are very tolerant of visitors, ready to offer a lazy tail wag for a friendly hello. Today I went in with the closed and sealed bag of Newman's Treats  The minute I opened the door, both dogs were on their feet, wagging all over, to greet me.  I have never seen these pups so excited to see me!  Was it my new haircut?  I think not!<br /><br />Each dog was delighted to get a treat... and another treat... and another treat, until I decided I'd better put the bag away or see them both explode.<br /><br />Newman's Treats are definitely doggie-approved."
5,Don't know if it really helps the teeth but the dogs love them!,"I have two rescued yorkies.  Yorkies are notorious for having problems with their teeth.  I am unable to get a toothbrush to their back teeth so I give them one of these each day to help keep their teeth clean.  Do they help?  I really don't know, but I'm not going to stop giving these to them to find out.  They absolutely love them.  They will ""sit"" and ""stay"" for them.  They will also ""leave it"" until I tell them to ""go"".  They are so well trained to ""leave it"" that I have to insist to get them to grab it.  Sometimes my little male gets himself so excited to get one of these, I swear if he had pants on, he'd pee in them.  I put one in front of him and one in front of my female and he'll be looking at hers and his - back and forth - trying to figure out how he can get both of them before she gets hers.  She seems to be deaf when I say ""go"", so I have to hand hers to her so he won't grab it out from under her.  Pretty comical and entertaining to watch.  Guess I should shoot a video of it so you can enjoy watching them as much as I do."
5,They Don't Get Any Better,"Donchels Cocoa Dusted Belgian Chocolate Truffles is really a superb candy.  In my experience they have only been bested by fresh chocolates, ones that have been prepared that very same day, (e.g., in NYC, a store called Li-Lac, cooks their deserts that very same day and when they run out of them, they run out.  They don't try to fake it by using yesterday's product.<br /><br />But barring those unusual offerings. Donchels is at the top of my list (for truffles).  The outer candy is firm, but not not crunchy, and the inner chocolate cream was soft, sweet, and simply melted in my mouth.<br /><br />I did not experience the gastrointestinal ""issues"" that some of the other reviewers here speak of because I limited myself to 3 of the truffles spread out through the day (the last being at bedtime).  That way I was always looking forward to something a bit later (and it took much will to avoid ""cheating""),  Certainly during the winter months, shipping should not be a problem (not so for late spring through late fall...these puppies tend to melt unless they are taken very good care of until delivery...I can't speak to that since I've always ordered them in cool/cold environments).  My advice: give them a try during the winter."
5,Great for Gluten Free Cooking and Baking,"I've been ordering this rice and also the Bob's Red Mill Organic White Rice Flour through Amazon's subscription for several months now. I couldn't be more pleased.  Bob's Rice flours are finely milled so there isn't that gritty taste in your foods.  I order at least 2 cases of each a month and I've never had a problem with any of my flours and all those I've received have been labeled ""organic"".  Would love to see Amazon offer Bob's Sweet Rice Flour and their White Bean Flour, too."
5,My dog loves Peanut Butter Smart Bones!,My dog loves Smart Bones Peanut Butter Dog Chew Minis...your dog will love them too! Good for digestion and affordable.
5,Wonderful Product - Very Fast shipping,I ordered this and had it delivered in just a couple of days.  It is a wonderfully soft fine milled white rye flour - exactly what I wanted but could not buy locally. 2 Tablespoons of this white rye flour in my regular white bread recipe improved the texture and crumb a tremendous amount.  Will buy from ThePreparedPantry again.  Thank you.
5,awesome hot cocoa,this mint hot cocoa smells and tastes so good.  it has just the perfect balance of mint and cocoa.  i highly recommend it.
5,Bar Harbor Chopped Clams,These clams are the best canned clams that I have found.  Most canned clams don't really taste like clams to me but these are appetizing looking and taste great.  I used them in a linguini with white clam sauce recipe and it was yummy!!
5,Best Gluten Free Cookies Out There!,These are my all time favorites and they never disappoint.  Each crunchy cookie is full of chocolate chips.
4,"Tastes great, but use care when preparing","This is the first time I've tried a microwaveable pasta product, and I found it to be quite good. The sauce was indeed spicy (I love spicy) and the flavor, while not quite as good as something you'd buy in a jar, was better than I expected. I liked the pasta, too. This isn't something I'd have regularly at home (I'd prefer to just cook pasta) but wouldn't mind eating regularly at work or some other place. I can see myself stocking up on a few.<br /><br />However, use extreme care when preparing. I followed the preparation instructions on the package and managed to give myself a first-degree burn. One side of the tray contains a removable sauce cup, the other the pasta. The idea is to peel back the cover a tad (for ventilation), microwave the food, then peel back the cover from the sauce cup and tray and dump the sauce on the pasta. Since the cover is stuck on the sauce cup there is a place to hold the sauce cup with your thumb while removing the cover.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cover adheres very well to the sauce cup. When trying to remove the cover my thumb slipped and hot pasta sauce dumped all over my right hand, resulting in a burn. Next time I think I'll peel back the cover to expose the sauce cup completely, and then put the cover back down and hold it in place with a small microwave-safe bowl while microwaving."
5,Almost as good as the lamb,"After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect."
5,coconut oil,I like it it smells soooo good it ship faster then what I put which is good thank you but it needs to melt lol
5,So great! I bought a bunch more as gifts.,"These let you make a baked apple in the microwave in 4 minutes or less with no mess.  Yummy warm treat for breakfast, dessert, whenever...<br />I used the one I got all the time and then decided to get them as a cute small holiday gift for the teachers at my kids' school (an apple for the teacher, ha ha).  I included a baked apple that I made that morning in tupperware, and a little recipe tag along with this apple baker."
4,Jelly Beans!  Chris Teifke loves them.,"These Jelly Belly Jelly Beans cam vacuum packed, fresh, and tasty.  I like being able to order individual flavors.  Excellent product.<br />- Chris Teifke"
4,Good except for tracking,"Silica litter has to be the best because it absorbs pee! And cats pee a lot more than they poop, so your litter box chore is greatly reduced. As long as you stir the crystals every day, this stuff is great. Unfortunately it is not dust-free."
4,Really equal to 5 LB bag of Sugar (not 10),"I been wanting to quit using Aspertame so I started using Splenda and store brands of sucralose. They put about 85% FILLER in the bags (dextrose for one, which is sugar!). They do that so a cup of splenda will equal out to a cup of sugar, like BIG DEAL! I want to buy sucralose, not FILLER! Anyhow, I love powdered Drink mix, been using KOOL AID and Whylers UN-Sweetened where instead of adding sugar, I added Splenda. This 2.0 fl oz bottle came in from Amazon and I wanted to give it a try. It says on the bottle that 1 Teaspoon = 2 Cups of Sugar. I always make a Gallon of KoolAid, so that 2 cups equal is perfect! I made it as normal, put in the fridge, oh and I left one full glass of the Splenda version that was from the last pitcher I made. 3 Hours later I try the drink and it's not sweet at all. Very under sweetened. So I added 1 more teasoon to the gallon pitcher, tasted about the same as the splenda brand now. So it's really 2 Teasoons = 2 cups of sugar (or 1 teaspoon = 1 cup of sugar). It says this is = to a 10 LB Bag of sugar on the box the bottle comes in, so it's really half of that. Still, you get 11 cups worth of sugar from this bottle (going by the 5 LB Bag usage), it's still alot cheaper to buy this than the big bag of splenda, the price is about the same, give or take a few dollars for the spenda 9 oz bag, that you only get about 6 cups of sugar tops.<br />  I would deff buy this again and will when I run out. Just wish they made this into a larger bottle, I mean like a bottle of Ketchup size, sure it would cost $50, but I'd buy it. This won't last me a real long time and I have never seen this pure Sucralose in stores.<br />  I have also been using Stevia of lates, NOW Foods on Amazon sells a huge 1 LB jar of it for $45. Now thats my style."
5,"So much better than ""baked"" chips","About 3 months ago I stayed at a hotel in Los Angeles and these chips were in the room, offered comp to hotel guests. I am not sure I would've tried them otherwise, but I am glad I did and now I'm addicted. I am a thin person so it's all about the taste for me, calories are not an issue. I've never really liked the taste of greasy chips, but baked chips seemed so bland. These chips are the best  and you should give them a try. They are tasty and not greasy. My personal favorite is the original potato flavor, but they are all pretty good.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I don't normally review food products but these were so good I wanted to share."
4,Great Cognitive Toy,After purchasing the Kyjen 6 squeaker snake from PetsMart and realizing that it was a great toy I quickly looked up Kyjen online and found/purchased several other toys.  One of which was this treat wheel.  I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix who I think is pretty smart but I was still worried that she wouldn't be able to figure out the puzzle.  She figured out how to lift off the yellow cups fairly quickly but it took her a few tries to figure out how to spin the wheel.  She's got it down to an art now and loves playing with this puzzle.  I am also amazed at the fact that she has not destroyed/chewed any part of this puzzle as she has destroyed almost all of her other toys.  I would definitely recommend this product to others who want to challenge their dog.
5,Good Price!,"I thought I wouldn't use that much, but after getting a bread machine, I use it weekly. Glad to have found a great product at a good price."
5,Lovely....,I love this. I have eaten a whole 100% cacao bar so this is a real treat to me. Dark Chocolate lovers will adore this and like someone said the fruity undertones complement it so well. I eat this instead of typical candy since it has antioxidants. The amazon price is really ridiculous though and would recommend people to check for this product in their grocery stores. I bought mine for about $2.50 with tax.
1,It isn't hulless,There were more hulls in this popcorn than in any other that I've ever used.  We found it to be very tough and after a couple of bites I ended up throwing it out.  Amazon gave me a full refund.  I would give them five stars for service.
4,wow!,"No cloying HFCS aftertaste!<br />Fresh-tasting and refreshing!<br />Just the right amount as a serving!<br />This is quite good, I must say."
3,"Usually good, sometimes bad.","I'm a regular purchaser of a variety of happy baby puffs, and the Banana flavor are usually a safe bet and my son really likes them (Strawberry is still his favorite).  Buyer beware though, this most recent order for the Banana flavor came and it seemed that the sealing process was fowled on 4 of the 6 packages in the box.  Puffs absorb moisture like no other so exposure from a poor seal on the container meant stale puffs.  Will this prevent me from purchasing again?  No.  Usually my puff orders are problem-free so give them a try.  I'm sure your kid (and you!) will love them!"
5,Great simple seasoning,"This is a great, simple seasoning - it is a bit heavy on the salt - but it is meant to be a salt based seasoning. A good blend of spices and they removed the MSG which was in the older version. You wont' be dissapointed and good value from Amazon."
5,Love this coffee,"I don't care for bold coffee so I was a little nervous getting my new coffee maker, I absolutely love this flavor! It is exactly what I was looking for."
5,BEST TASTING TEA DRINK,I'VE BEEN DRINKING THIS MIX SINCE IT FIRST CAME OUT. PREVENTION MAGAZINE RATED IT THE BEST ON THE MARKET FOR ANTIOXIDENTS! I ALWAYS LIKED THAT IT WAS SO GOOD FOR ME AND TASTED GREAT. I CAN'T FIND IT IN STORES NOW SO THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE I CAN GET IT.
2,Did not work for us,"We ordered the medium/large tug jug.  It smelled like plastic so strongly my dog would not go near it no matter what food we put in it.  I tried it with a friends dog four times and the dog could not connect that kibble came out when he let go.  All he wanted to do was tug.  The rope was so stiff he couldn't really get a grip on it and the rope also smelled of chemicals.  Between the BPA in the bottle and cap and the inflexible rope, we found it was unusable and sent it back."
1,"Nestle Quality Street Candies, actual Tin size","I love Quality Streets and was delighted to see them on here, but I feel I was mislead with the description and picture. I was expecting the normal size (larger) tin for this $27.75, but instead I got a less than half size tin. The picture is misleading with no scale reference. I've seen this often on here especially around Brit foods, they find the smallest package picture them as the norm that we are familiar with and flog them at the large package price. Elsewhere on the net I could have bought the large tin for less than they charged for this small tin had I known what to expect."
3,ok sprinkles,"i was ordering these sprinkles to decorate goodies for my son's 2nd bday party...  they arrived promptly, however just looking at the contents in the bag it appears a lot of the sprinkles are broken and now in crumbs...  i haven't opened the bag yet to see the extent of the damage, but i'm thinking it may have come in better condition if it were in a hard container like sprinkles you buy at the store (these sprinkles were in a bag & shipped in a box)..."
1,"Cheap, Cake batter is Bisquick","Got it for a friend, so naturally I didn't open it to look, everything was thin and cheap. Save yourself money, get pancake mix and a real pitcher. The cake ring can be found at a thrift store..."
5,Delicious and good for you!,"These are organic super yummy tortilla rounds.  I really like them.  They are on the salty side, but that's good for me."
5,Excellent Coffee,"I've been drinking this coffee every morning for the last two weeks and I like it very much. I enjoy the flavor, the aroma and the aftertaste. I don't know what more to say, other than the fact that I'm a coffee drinker, I love it and I love this very excellent coffee."
1,These are like Fruit Gems?  I think NOT!!,"These arrived today.  Based on another review, I had expected them to be similar to Sunkist Fruit Gems.  Any similarity, for me, was dashed as soon as I opened the bag - the candy smells like room deodorizer.  I still had hopes, though, until I tried to eat one.  The outside of the candy is as tough as shoe leather, and the inside is almost liquid.  I tried one of each ""flavor"" - they all taste the same, and that tast lingers - on and on and on.  Oh - and there is no nutritional information on the package - I thought that was pretty much standard now, if not a requirement.  The price is good, especially if you do Subscribe and Save, and that is why I gave this product the one star.  Personally, I would prefer to pay more and get something I like."
2,Strong and overpowering,"I drink a lot of tea and was looking for something with another flavor to try.  I like ginger and know it is supposed to have soothing remedies so I thought this Instant Ginger Lemon Drink would be something to try.  The first thing I noticed was the aroma, it smells great, a very strong ginger smell.  I added the 250ml of water and tried it and it was just so strong.  I did not taste the lemon and the ginger was overpowering. I added double the amount of water and tried it again.  It is still very strong and spicey and to much for me.  I wouldn't purchase this again."
5,Strong full-bodied taste. Best ESE pods in the market.,"I'm an espresso lover. Most ESE pods don't taste like the authentic Italian espresso that's extracted the traditional way. illy Caffe Scura pods is the closest you can get to an actual espresso shot. I love it's strong full-bodied taste. For me, this is the best ESE pods I've ever tried."
5,does what a cereal should do!,"This is a delicious choice for breakfast.  I thought it wouldn't hold me from hunger for long because it was flakes, but it really does a good job!  It stays crunchy considerably well, and has just the right sweetness.  Tastes healthy, but not in a gross way :0) You feel like you are making a good decision to eat it.  Definitely worth it, because of the volume of cereal you get!"
5,Yummy!,I really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half & half for creaminess. Being that I am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. The local stores sell this as well but it's half the amount of cups and almost the same price. Buy from Amazon.
5,Real Japanese taste!!,"This soba's quality and taste are very good!<br />Since I am Japanese, I have eaten many kinds of sobas in my life.<br />So, I know the real Japanese Soba taste. It remains firmness and soba flavor after<br />boiling it. It is made in Australia, but the quality is guaranteed, and I can highly recommend it.<br />Pricewise is also very reasonable. Please enjoy real Japanese taste!"
5,Try with coconut oil!,"We had waffles made with this mix in a hotel and they were great, so we decided to get some for home use.  On a whim I substituted coconut oil for the 2 Tbs. butter called for in the recipe, and wow, was it ever good.  The coconut flavor compliments the vanilla and malt flavors well, and reminds me of Shipley's Donuts, which are fried in a coconut oil blend."
5,i cant believe how much my dog loves these,i have a 12lb dachshund mix and i am amazed at how quickly she got hooked on these- she is a power-chewer for sure and in a month and a half destroyed one - the second one is holding up substantially better.  best chew-toy ever.
5,We love this syrup,"Our family loves this syrup. I try to find foods for my family that don't have sugar in them because we all seem so much happier and healthier when we don't eat sugar. So, this syrup is wonderful because it has only natural fruit sugar and tastes great. I also love that it doesn't contain artificial sweetners which I feel are worse for my children than sugar. Since I can't buy it in any grocery stores in my area, I order it online by the case. That's how much I love it. My children love pancakes and waffles with syrup and this syrup makes me and my kids happy."
5,"People say this is good for you, but I ENJOY it!","As a Type 2 diabetic, I have to be careful about food -- especially with what I eat for breakfast. This is REALLY good -- as good as any muesli I've ever tasted, both hot and cold.<br /><br />Dress it up with a little fresh fruit or nuts, and vary them, and you will have a breakfast you can enjoy every day, but still have a variety!<br /><br />Then, my wife had the inspiration to add some dried cherries (available from Amazon), some chocolate chips, and some chopped pecans and made some superb cookies from this. They had the texture of an oatmeal cookie, but were IMHO far superior to any oatmeal cookes I've tried. If you want the recipe, send me a comment, and I'll send it to you.<br /><br />The product is delivered in convenient bags that are well sealed and protective of the product.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,watch out...,"I would have preferred to directly inform the company that makes this product vs. writing a review on Amazon but I couldn't find a way to do that.<br /><br />First I would like to thank the makers of Lickety Stik for donating these things to a Canine Cancer walk I participated in this weekend.<br /><br />I have 2 dogs, as it seemed, one dog liked it and the other did not.<br /><br />I screwed the cap back on and put it on the counter while I took a shower and when I came out I found the Lickety Stik butsted open on my couch and leaking all over the place.  The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak."
1,Needs Truth in Labeling,"The ingredients list on Amazon is incorrect according to the label on the food. I purchased this food through PetFoodDirect, and their website has the same incorrect list, as does the By Nature website itself as of this date (July 17, 2011). The label on the food I bought says that the food also contains pea flour and menadione dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite (a toxic synthetic vitamin K). I emailed By Nature about this, and received this reply on June 29, 2011 from Ray Devone, Customer Service Coordinator, Kent Nutrition Group:<br /><br />""Thank you for calling these apparent discrepancies to our attention! There has never been Menadione in any of our foods. In fact, we printed labels listing this ingredient and decided to forgo adding this controversial supplement to our foods - after the labels went to print. Obviously, we have not run out of this first printing of labels yet - and I have asked that we put a 'blip' somewhere with words to  that effect.  We did indeed switch from the controversial gums and carrageenan to pea flour and I have further asked that we update websites, as well as labels for accuracy sake.  To answer your question:  The pea flour is new; the Menadione never was.""<br /><br />The label on the food also lists guar gum and locust bean gum, so I'm not sure what controversial gums the pea flour replaced.<br /><br />Anyway, if your cats don't like pea flour (mine don't) or you're looking for a low-carbohydrate food, avoid By Nature Organics Chicken & Chicken Liver canned cat food.<br /><br />Truth in labeling matters."
5,By far my favorite k cup,Green mountain got it right this time! This is one of my favorite k cup flavors and the aroma is amazing. Just like dunkin donuts pumpkin spice coffee but way cheaper to brew at home. I am sad this is a seasonal flavor because I would drink this all year round! Way to go green mountain you found the perfect mix of pumpkin and spice and it is not overwhelming with the spice like all other pumpkin spice products I have tried!
3,Great product but poor advertising on Amazon's part,"Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!"
4,"Excellent flavor, good value, but some issues to be aware of","It's hard to find good decaf loose tea that is affordably priced and tastes good. I'm pleased to report that this English Breakfast from Coffee Bean Direct hits the mark on both counts. Excellent taste - depending on how long the steeping process, it ranges from a very light, refreshing taste that goes well as an iced tea, to a very hearty - but not bitter - taste that really hits the spot.<br /><br />I've had better tasting tea, but on a cost/value basis, this is outstanding.<br /><br />The downside is that, as with any decaf loose tea, you're not getting the full leaf format that our caffeinated tea brethren enjoy. This is very fine, almost powdery in consistency. This is where the higher priced teas pay off -- whilie their decaf process also results in broken leafs, it is not anywhere as fine or powdery as this.<br /><br />The fine/powdery nature presents some challenges in brewing, since the typical perforated tea ball will not be suitable. I'm using a mesh tea ball and it works pretty well, albeit there is still some tea residue in the bottom of the cup. If you want absolutely zero leaf residue you'll need to use one of those tea bag systems where you put the loose tea in a bag. Those, however, are not reusable more than a few times. As usual, trade-offs.<br /><br />Of greater significance is that the decaf process for this particular tea is not perfect - there is still some caffeine left. I'm very sensitive to caffeine levels, and this tea clearly has more caffeine than, for example, a bagged Lipton decaf. I'd put the caffeine level below what a regular green tea would hold, but there is still enough there to be noticeable. Again, I'm very sensitive to caffeine, so for most people I imagine that would not be an issue."
5,oatmeal cookies,What happened to the oatmeal cookies. You've been out of stock for months. Are you getting them in? They are the best !
5,Coffee,This type of Folgers coffee is the best around...I have tried other brands of the same flavor and none compare
3,Not the best,"With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.<br />The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short."
1,Make your own!,"This stuff is so bad, you may as well call it 'crap in a packet'. There are few words to describe the Walden Farms dressings/sauces, that can be printed here on Amazon. If Clorox made mouth rinse, I'd need it after tasting these chemical bombshells."
3,"Yeah, adds some nice flavor but chemical after-taste...","Yeah - not so much.  MIO Mango Peach liquid 'enhancer': just add to water for a bit of 'nice' flavor and you're all set...but, in my opinion, although the taste is reasonably pleasant, the chemical-like after-taste and the chemicals inside that you are putting in your body, are what made me decide not to use this again.  I added about 3 squirts to a bottle of water, which created a bright orange cherry red color (too much chemical coloring!) and a pleasant taste of mango peach, but also created an after-taste of chemical sweetener.  I tried it on a few different ocassions, with the same results.  As someone who used to drink liquids with sweeteners, this would not have bothered me before, but it's quite noticeable to me now.  I would recommend adding fresh lime or lemon to your water instead."
3,Oily rather than creamy,"I have very dry curly hair, and tried this on my hair after washing. It doesn't blend well with wet hair, so I tried it after my hair dried. The balm is oily, rather than creamy, and a little bit goes a long way. A touch on the fingertips massaged into the hair and scalp gives hair a nice non-frizzy curl. My scalp also didn't get the dry itch it sometimes does. I wouldn't recommend it though, for other than very dry hair as it can get the hair oily if too much is used. Another thing is that it doesn't wash out easily if you find you did use too much."
3,Koolaid for grownups,"From the new line of Crystal Light Moctails, we have the Mojito version.  Little packet of greenish powder, added to water gives you a pitcher full of sweet mojito-ish alcohol free drink.  Each packet should make 2 quarts, but it actually better with a little less than that and a lot of ice.  I didn't try substituting rum for water.  If I want a rum-filled mojito, thats what I""ll have and not just toss rum into some crystal light.<br />Overall, not bad.  The sweetener is too heavy and it would be more refreshing with less.  I rarely have a need to make a full pitcher of anything, so a 16 ounce version might be better.  But the important thing is the flavor.  If it tasted really great, I wouldn't care what size it made and I'd happily add rum and use it as a mojito base.  It doesn't quite make the grade for that though.  Compared to other koolaid type drinks, its tasty and different.  I can't recommend it to mojito lovers because it is a poor imposter.  But its not bad as a midsummer refresher."
5,These tastes pretty good,"These tastes good. If it's not fried, not bad for you, and tastes good, then why not eat them? Of course, not a lot at once, but these are great healthier snacks."
4,good tea,"A most enjoyable, if somewhat faint, tea. My daughter just came back from China and she said it was the best tea she's had since China. Somewhat to the whie tea side (2 buds) of green tea (and a leaf), I prefer a greener tea that tastes more like spinach, but then again I am somewhat of a western peasant."
3,"Smells Aweful, but Jimmy Loves It",I can't stand the smell of this treat.  They are very bite-sized (tiny little beads).  I wouldn't mind them so much if they smelled a little better.  As it stands I can't be near the opened bag without getting naseous.  My daughter feeds him treats now.
1,Not what was ordered,Good coffee but not the product I ordered. Was supposed to be Decaf coffee but received regular. Did not realize until after product was opened this weekend. Poor quality control....
4,What a deal!,"I purchased the Zuke's mini salmon treats from other pet stores before. They come in 6 oz. bag for almost $6.  I can't believe when I found the 1 lb. bag for $9 on Amazon and I ordered it as my Shih Tzu loves these salmon treats.  We used them to train her.  It uses all natural ingredients which is very important to us.  However, it can be kind of smelly since it is made of fish(salmon)."
5,oatmeal companion,"I love these little munchies! Every morning at work, I throw a few in the bottom of a styrofoam cup, scoop some oats and a little brown sugar on top, add some hot water and ta-da, yummy breakfast! The water plumps up the fruit very nicely. Much tastier than oatmeal pouches, and much healthier than the craisins, dried blueberries, and other sugar-fortified fruits I used to add to my oats. A handful of these fruit munchies also makes a great mid-afternoon snack."
5,Yummy!,My 2 year old and my 8 month old both love these. I wish there were more calories in these but they are yummy and perfect for toddlers learning to feed themselves. Dissolves very quickly. The sweet potato and peach flavour are my favorites. :)
5,"This nutrition-nut/water  connoisseur agrees that Essentia Water delivers unmatched hydration, health and taste","I love this water!  I was offered it on Amazon Vine program but have already received 4 more subscribe-and-save cases!<br /><br />It is always good to know a little about the reviewer and so I should say most people would consider me a nutrition nut and a water connoisseur.  I have spent thousands of dollars on equipment to improve my whole-house water, shower water, tap water, and drinking water.  I do not drink soda more than twice a YEAR and coffee not more than once a DECADE!  I drink water as my beverage of choice and have tried every water carried by my healthfood stores.  Other than my personally treated tap water, I have preferred a couple brands of spring water bottled in glass.  I was happy to see that Essentia is in BPA and Phthalate free recyclable bottles.<br /><br />My diet is the best money can buy and I naturally maintain an 85% alkaline-forming diet with my food selection.  When I agreed to receive this Essentia water on the Vine program, my plans were to drink a couple of bottles to review and save the remainder for emergency situations such as what happened only months ago in San Diego when our county lost electricity and the water became questionable to drink with the water treatment plant not operating without electricity.  However, after my first bottle of water, I desire no other drinking water, and have subscribed to 4 cases which I have already received from Amazon.  BTW, they arrived each in their own box each weighing a little over 30 pounds.<br /><br />Why did I switch to Essentia?  Just like the manufacturer says ""Try it for the taste.  Buy it for the benefits"", it tastes great!  My diet/water choice criteria is not what tastes best with some health-benefit but rather what is most health beneficial that also isn't unpleasant to drink/eat.  Although my diet/water has been optimum for most of my life, I am going through hormonal changes because I am ""of that age"" uh-um.  I started having severe hot flashes that wake me up at night and cause me to strip down naked and cold shower during the day.  I tried all the remedies known that are helpful without side effects.  No relief for me!  I was surprised beyond description when the Essentia water resolved my hot flashes!  It feels very cooling and soothing going down and as long as I keep that cool smooth feeling inside, I have merely mild flashes and those only occasionally. I am so thankful to Essentia!  Drinking the water I had on hand that I thought was optimal had not helped the hot flashes at all even when treated to supposedly be alkaline.  So I do not know exactly what it is about Essentia that is working for me as I have not scientifically experimented with it to see if it is one of the ingredients or what.<br /><br />Thank you Essentia for resolving my hot flashes which were really wearing me out!<br /><br />Although Essentia water is a little more expensive to buy it on Amazon, I decided to purchase here.  My local Whole Foods offers 20% off cases and my local Jimbo's offers 10% off cases and I have not asked Henry's, Sprouts, or other grocers what their discounts are; so it would actually be a little cheaper for me to buy it locally but then I have to carry it to the car and from the car to my home and it is much nicer for me to pay a little extra and have it delivered by UPS so I do not have to move the bottles by the 30pound case but only by a bottle or two at a time.  Also, Essentia gives healthcare professionals, such as myself, 30% off but require a 10 case minimum purchase and I do not want to store 10 cases at a time as in California as space is at a premium and in high demand.  4 cases is optimal for me and I am willing to pay a little extra to not have to carry it myself.<br /><br />Thank you Essentia and Amazon!  You make my life better!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Sprouts sells this for $1.89 for each 1.5liter with 10% discount for a case - no sales tax.  If you don't have great spring water locally (google findaspring), I prefer this bottled water to everything else at Sprouts and most local grocers."
5,Adicted,"My daughter bought me some of this coffee when she went to the Caymans.  I have become adicted to it and make it by the cupful in my Keurig.  I love it so much I send it to my friends and family as well, and they love it as much as I do.  I'm glad I can buy it at a lower cost on Amazon than at other sites.  But it is worth every penny anyway. M-m-m-m-m-m..."
1,So disappointing!,"This sad confection is a perfect example of why you shouldn't do your grocery shopping while you're hungry. It was a total impulse buy and i was REALLY excited about it. No eggs? No dairy? Hooray a cookie for vegans like me! It sounded perfect. When i got home and took a bite i was SO disappointed. There's hardly any lemon flavor to it and it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. It was like trying to swallow paste. I tried a few more bites to give it a fair chance ... but wound up throwing the majority of the cookie in the trash.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i paid over $2 for this darn atrocity. Ah well... lesson learned."
3,Bland,"My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isn't much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  We'll drink this until it's gone...but it's the last flavor we choose, and it's lasting way too long!"
2,I really wanted to like this stuff. I really did.,"Unfortunately, it didn't have much of a chocolate taste, had a very strong chemical aftertaste, and didn't dissolve well. Ultimately, I gave it to my wife, who made chocolate muffins from it. (The baking seemed to evaporate the funny tasting chemicals, and a healthy dose of additional cocoa gave the batter more of a chocolate taste than the syrup had.) Wouldn't use this for drinks, though. Neither the consistency nor the taste is appealing."
5,Great bars~,Great nutritional bar that is good for breakfast!<br /> Contain lots of fiber and great for snack anytime - will have to keep on hand great for weight loss as well!
5,Tasty coffee,"I really enjoyed all but 2 of these coffees, they are very sweet and flavorful. I still use the mug today, it has a convenient lid that is very easy to take apart and clean. The tin is still around too, and paint hasn't even come off of it yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes coffee(unless they only like really strong, dark coffee). Would make a great gift for a college student or younger person who drinks coffee."
5,Cat's favorite,These treats are my picky cat's favorite.  I've tried about 8 different brands in the past and these are always the preferred kind.  Highly recommended!
1,YUCK! ...after the wild salmon this tastes tinny,"First I had the wild salmon and ordered it a few times in a row, till they decided to bump it up in price over 50% (from 11 something to 17 something) I don't like the Wild Salmon one enough to suddenly go from paying less than $2 a can to nearly $3, though it's surprisingly good. By comparison this tuna and noodle tastes ""off"" tinny or something just not right with the taste. I took a few bites and took a break - then took a few more bites and disposed of most of the can. I cannot recommend the tuna and noodles at all. Blech..."
5,Innovative,"Cereals haven't really been very exciting since somebody figured out that you can sell more to kids if you coat the grains with sugar. However, Krave is actually a fresh idea in a supermarket aisle dominated by the health-conscious and the sugary extremes. The cereal has a whole grain exterior with a chocolate inside. The exterior is soft to the bite while the chocolate taste is subtle - definitely noticeable, but toned down from those sugary excesses. It's neither too unhealthy nor tastelessly healthy - just the right combination. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something besides Cheerios or Cocoa Puffs."
5,Nice Product,"I spent a few weeks in the Southwest on my annual camping trip this year and enjoyed ""Prickly Pear Margaritas"" at a number of places.<br />Add a dollup of this to any Margarita and convert it to a ""Prickly Pear Margarita"".  It's also great on pancakes and waffles.<br />The pricing on this product makes it a pretty good value."
2,"great idea, needs work","Just recently purchase as I like the soda taste but not the amount of sugar in Soda.  Have tried all flavors and regardless of soda, they all have the DIET aftertaste.  If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute."
5,Best Chocolate cookies,These traditional German cookies are my favorite. I've been eating them since I was a small child. These are big cookies and are the perfect combination between biscuit and chocolate.
5,Wonder Flavor,I was happily surprised by the fullness of flavor provide by this coffee.<br />It is a wonderful alternative to whatever your standard K-Cup coffee is<br />Try it I'm sure you'll agree
5,I love them:),"I have always liked these but I haven't had them in years.  Today, I was hungry and saw them at the natural market checkout counter.  I got the flavor ""spicy 'chicken'"" and LOVED it.  It is clear that this is a love or hate product.  I buy Primal Strips when in need of a snack I can eat in the car and they are just ok...oily and get stuck in my teeth.  Flavor is just OK.  Stonewall's are drier and puffier and chewier but somehow, don't get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />I am on a low-carb diet and these are only 7 g of carbs for 13 g of protein.  I am getting a case of the original mild since it is Prime.  Would like to see more flavors available on Prime.<br /><br />Definitely suggest buying a small pack first given the love/hate aspect."
1,Wierd Taste,"I was really looking forward to having some good apple cider out of my Keurig machine. The cider has a wierd taste to it and a very bad aftertaste. After my wife and I both tried a cup, we ended up throwing the rest of it out."
3,A little stale...but I'll give them another chance,"I searched out my favorite KIND bars on Amazon because I was buying them every day at the mini mart for nearly two dollars each.  These are the best; not too sweet, very filling, perfect for a post-workout craving.  I signed up for Subscribe and Save to get the best deal and because I know I'll go through these things. My first delivery came within a week but I'm sad to say that they were stale.  Not flat-out gross, thankfully they still taste good. But they are super hard and chewy (much more so than normal) and appear to have been exposed to high heat, like they melted a bit at some point.  I've got to admit that I never looked at the expiration date on one that I've bought at a mini mart, but that's probably because they've never been stale or given me cause to question the freshness. As it turns out, the case I have now was delivered in September 2012 and expires in October 2013, so they should be fine. Hopefully, this was just a fluke and the next case will be better.  If not, they're getting returned and I'll find another source.  So, the KIND Fruit & Nut bars would normally get 5 stars from me, but my experience by ordering them through Amazon brought them down a few stars.  I'll try to remember to update in the future."
4,Good expresso,"I usually have four or more cups of strong black coffee every day, and I like to pick up a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CDP2XA"">Starbucks DoubleShot Espresso Drink 12 ct</a> if I am starting my day away from my coffee pot, so I have tried this kind of drink before. If you don't like the ""burnt coffeepot"" taste of espresso, then don't get this product. I put this on par with Starbuck's product of the same type. Would I go out of my way to get this product instead of Starbucks? No, I would not. In my area, this product is significantly more expensive than Starbuck's. So, I would get this product if it is available for less $$, which at retail, usually isn't less $$."
5,Great Coffee,I start my morning with this coffee each day.  Great taste and great price. I have ordered this coffee several times and will buy again.
5,"Great cookies, terrible deal","I can buy a single pack (32 cookies) for $1 at my local Kroger. $1.<br /><br />Now, if you don't live near a retailer and you know how AMAZING these cookies are, then by all means, purchase them for this insane rate. It's surely a treat for those unable to buy it anywhere local who have a craving for them. But do yourself a favor and check the grocery first.<br /><br />$1."
5,lowry's pork rinds,We were very pleased with the product and have introduced family and friends to it and all have been very pleased and suprised so we will be continuing to order these. Great product.
5,What can I say about mustard?,"I live in Florida and during hurricane season, electricity frequently goes out.  So any mustard in the frig is only good for a day or two.  So I like to have packets of mustard that will keep fresh for a long period of time.  And they are also great for picnics and school lunches as well.  My order in arrived in less than a week."
5,YUMMY!!! Arrived promptly without issues.,"I've always liked Hormel chili, No, it isn't healthly eating, but when time is at a premium, a quickly heated bowl will do your taste buds and tummy good. I bought these based on other reviews and I was pleased buy the taste. This is the BEST canned chili I have ever tasted. I bought this along with some other canned goods. (See other reviews.) I'm working on building up my emergency food and kits and this 6pk of cans fit the bill nicely in quantity, price and expiration date of 12/14. Name brands aren't important to me as price, but this package was a good deal.<br />The pop-up cans arrived promptly in advertised condtion without dents. No issues here. Whether you're stocking up your home or emergency food supply, I can recommend these without any hesitation. This is yummy for your tummy."
3,Strong and Bold flavor,"When I got to enjoy a cup of Kona on our vacation to Hawaii, I thought I was in Heaven.  The smooth flavor was something to enjoy at any time of day or night.  This Kona brand seemed very strong to me - I even tried not using to much coffee and more water and it still seemed too stong.  I missed the smoothness and flavor of the Kona I remembered in Hawaii.  For that reason, I do not think it's the same Kona I loved so much and would rate this coffee at a 3."
5,Great Oatmeal,"This stuff is great. My family can not tell the difference between this, McCainns and Honeyville Farms. All three taste great. 10 pounds will fill a coffee can sized container and a gallon bag.<br /><br />Bring 3.5 cups water plus pinch of salt in pan to rolling boil. Before you go to bed, add 1 cups oat groats plus two rounded tablespoons pecan meal to the water. Stir. Turn off the burner / remove from heat when it almost foams to the edge. Cover and lit sit on the stove overnight. In the morning, heat individual bowls in the microwave. I add a bit of milk and one tablespoon brown sugar. We prefer our oatmeal thicker than standard porridge and this is more than enough for 4. The thickest I have made it is 3.5 cups water to 1.25 cups oat groats.<br /><br />The pecan meal adds nutty flavor. You can make meal using your blender to process nuts."
5,jelly beans kirkland,the jelly beans arrived on time they taste great they fit perfectly into my new gum ball candy machine i orded  from amazon i always wanted one in my home and they beans are a perfect match  i will definelty order them again<br /><br />happys beans<br />T :)
5,Great Doggy Time Consuming Purchase,"My dog doesn't digest rawhide, and I found out the hard way that her body doesn't digest the elk antler chew toys. The Himalayan dog chew was a great alternative. She's a small breed dog, but I give her the 2.5 oz chew, because it lasts longer and keeps her busy. She'll spend up to an hour at a time chewing on it. When she's chewing on something she shouldn't, I give her the himalayan chew as an alternative. It's all natural, and Jozi easily digests the chew. Great product."
4,Not great for cooking....,"I use coconut oil for as much as I can...  Skincare, hair, cooking, etc.  I will say that this product is better for skincare and hair.  My husband has loved the change now that I'm cooking with coconut oil but when I used this one on his morning eggs he new immediately that it was a new one.  He said ""I can really taste the coconut in my eggs"".  So I switched back to my other organic coconut oil for cooking."
1,soggy and stale!,This is the first and last time I will be ordering food from Amazon. My 4 year old is addicted to Mini Nilla Wafers. I can't seem to find them in any stores where I live so I had to resort to ordering online. The cookies were extremely soggy and stale. DO NOT order food online. It's not worth it!
4,Good coffee bad seals,"Coffee rich and strong no problem. However about half broke open during the brewing process,getting grounds in my coffee and all over.  Obviously a defect in top cup seal packaging. Eventually I cut off the bottom of the cup and it relived the pressure so as to not blow seal."
5,Yummy,"Tastes just like theatre popcorn alright!  Convenient, too.  First we tried Orville Redenbacher kernals and popping oil.  Not good.  These packs are a little pricey but well worth it."
4,Good herbal tea,Bought the sampler just to try it and I did like all the flavors.  But I wasn't blown away by it and I don't know if I like it enough to get it again anytime soon (since there's so many other teas to try).  But it is good tea and has an antioxidant content. Also it is a nice change if your a constant green tea drinker.  Definitely worth a try if your in the super market.
5,"Great Espresso, easy clean up!","Lavazza Gran Crema makes a great tasting espresso/latte and the pods make clean up quick.  It has a lower price than other brands, without sacrificing flavor."
1,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
4,Yum,"Good coffee. I typically don't like coffee that is already ground, but this one is great!I suggest that you decrease the amount you would normally use because it's a bit stronger than most other brands."
5,Love these Bites!,My grandson loves these brownie bites and I can no longer find them in the store. Thanks for offering them online. You are a lifesaver.
1,broken cookies,I have ordered more than 12 cases of Murrays cookies in the past.  This shipment of cookies more than half of the cookies in the sack were broken.  This is either a manufacturing problem or a shipment problem with this order.
5,Good product,"This is a good product, no artificial ingredients, MSG or hydrogenated oils and it tastes great! Make sure you give plenty of time for it to be delivered, took nearly three weeks to be delivered to me. Good enough though that I will probably plan ahead and re-order."
5,Excellent product,Excellent product and transaction so glad I was able to find these on amazon. No more fuss about meds with our pup! She gobbles them down!
4,Good,"I like the size of the bottle the Essentia comes in as it is a 1.5 liter. It will last you a while if you are carrying it outside for work, sports, or outdoor activities.<br /><br />The manufactor uses a special technology to get a 9.5 ph. The bottle says, ""purified water infused with electrolytes for a difference you can taste."" it seems it can help hydrate, but I disagree with a part of the statement. The water taste good, yet it taste just like any other water in a bottle. My wife tried it and could not taste a difference either."
5,Happy discovery!!,"A few years ago Friskies produced a similar ""meat & gravy"" product which I quickly bought.  My five cats refused to eat it, just licked the gravy.  When I spotted this new product, I decided to try it once more.  It was A HUGE SUCCESS!!!!  My five cats loved it from the first bite and actually licked their dishes clean, all varieties.  I highly recommend it to anyone who might have had a similar experience with the original product.  I will continue to buy it as long as it is available.  Thank you, Friskies!"
5,Yum-E,"The cinnamon roll flavored K cups are super delicious. I am not a fan of flavored coffee, I usually prefer a flavored creamer but this coffee is so yummy that I didn't even add creamer to my coffee! Talk about cutting calories!"
5,Stopped my eye twitching...,"My left eye had been twitching on and off throughout the day for the last 1-2months.  after the 2nd day of natural calm it began to lessen and now after  a few weeks nothing.  coincidence, i don't think so and i'm a healthcare provider."
5,Excellent seller Excellent product!,"I enjoyed this product immensely.  The product came quickly and had a year to expiration.  IF you are a honey type of person, this is your bar, the taste is prevalent even among the cranberry!  YUM"
4,not a bad caviar for price.,we will order again!our grandkids wanted to try caviar. We didn't want to spend a fortune if they did not like. we were actually pleasantly surprised with quality.
1,Revolting!,I was really disappointed in this - it was just horrible. Too sweet and with a really weird aftertaste. I'm used to the taste of artificial sweeteners in hot and cold drinks but this was something else. We have a Keurig at work so I took it to the office but there haven't been many takers. Avoid!
4,great for people with food allergies,"I have Celiac's in addition to corn,rice,potato & more allergies so to find a product I can use is really amazing. The flavor is good, I can't use egg so it comes out a little hard, but I make calzones with hamburger & onions inside using this chebe mix and it satisfies my craving for carbs.<br />All I add to the mix is 3tbsp oil and roughly 10tbsp of water."
2,Creamy....but unimpressive.,"I was looking forward to a hearty, rich soup, and instead got this Corn Chowder- the corn was soggy and not crisp, the soup was almost 'curdled' even though it was defintely within the shelf life of the product, and the smell...well, my husband actually asked if I'd opened up a can of dog food in the house. The flavor was bland and slightly salty. I took a few bites and threw it out- however, I am a picky eater, and some people might enjoy this, if they like thick, greasy food."
4,lots of fun,"Highly entertaining to watch.  Both of my dogs LOVE it.  The older one has a little more trouble with it,but he can do it!  He hasn't quit figured out that he has to move the yellow cups before the wheel will turn.  On the other hand my younger dog thought that removing the yellow cups WAS the game.  Had to show him that there was something inside.  Does very well removing the cups now.  Timing him he is down to a little over 2 minutes.  You do have to show them how it works a few times if you don't have a super smart dog."
2,Got Fish?,"These come packed in a bag of what I can only assume is fish juice. To put it simply, they reek of fish. Rinsing them off and boiling them only helps to some extent; you're going to need to drown them in something strong if you don't like your noodles to smell like week-old carp. Once you get past the smell, they are a reasonable replacement for noodles, though they are more chewy than the real thing and they have sort of a tangy aftertaste. They might be okay in an oriental dish, but they were ghastly by themselves (I tired both fettuccini and red meat sauce)."
5,Wow!,"We are cutting back on coffee at home for a variety of reasons and no longer brew an entire pot. We love coffee...tried all kinds of brewing, brands, and roasts and still plan to. For morning convenience, we tried instant, Starbucks VIA.  While wonderful, I found the price per serving to be only practical while traveling and not for everyday use. I stumbled across this coffee at the grocery and thought I'd give it a shot. Well, I am hooked. Tastes great and it is much easier to create a cup while still half sleepy.  Avid Amazon shopper, so I will get it here next time.  Did I mention that it only costs about 8 cents/cup?"
5,Ordering K-Cups Coffee thru Amazon is quick and easy!!,"Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig Brewers<br />This is really a no brainer!! All you do is give Amazon the order you want to get on a monthly basis and it is delivered straight to your home - no getting in your car, driving, waiting in line OR waiting for a good deal - this is it!!"
4,Very healthy,"I dont really worry about my weight these days.  These bars are not exactly low calorie, though, in the writeup I read on the internet I , the guy who created the product says he sometimes eats a couple  of them for lunch. That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories. So much better for you than a candy bar. I read an interview the magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try other bars also, where they are selling them everywhere . I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this one, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did."
4,Hard,"Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard."
5,K-lips,Very good price and excellent coffee.. Packed perfect it is less than 60 cents per cup. I will always order my k-kups from amazon
5,I think they've changed this formula...,"So I've tried the terrible tasting version of Zico Mango that a lot of folks are describing, but I think they've changed the formula because now it is delicious. Like others, I've gotten a little addicted to coconut water, not just for when I work out, but for this incredibly hot and long summer we've had here in Texas.<br />My mother and I work out together, and I decided to buy all the Zico flavors, thinking she'd especially like the Mango (which I reeeally did NOT like). So she tasted all of them, while giving me feedback (her least favorites being the Lima Citron and Natural bc she likes sweeter drinks than I). She said the Mango tasted more like coconut, which is not at all what I recalled. I tasted it, and I've got to say- this one is now my favorite. The mango flavor is subtle, the coconut flavor more pronounced.<br />I agree with previous reviewers. The old version is almost unpalatable (sickeningly sweet and pungent), and I could barely finish the bottle (actually it was in the cardboard/ paper container).<br />For those of you who've tried and disliked the Mango flavor, I'd suggest giving it another shot in a few weeks. Hopefully the old inventory will be gone, because this new flavor is delicious. Really delicious! I've bought a a couple cases on Amazon of the Chocolate Zico, but will continue to buy the Mango from my grocer bc I know its inventory is new.<br />Order of favorites? They are:<br /><br />Mango (new formula)<br />Chocolate; Pina Tropicale; Pineapple (like equally)<br />Lima Citron<br />Pomberry<br />Natural (tastes good in smoothies, though!)<br /><br />I've tried other versions- there's one brand with vitamins and quercetin... yuck! Then another with ginseng and gingko biloba (O.N.E., berry flavor) that was pretty good, but too energy drink- like. I'll continue to try other brands but not sure I really need too :)"
3,Excellent for a peanut bar!,"This bar is super yummy, but I have to agree that falsely advertising it as an almond walnut macadamia bar, when most of the bar is peanuts, is a big turn off!"
5,Walkerswood Jamaican Mild Jerk Seasoning,"This Walkerswood Jamaican Jerk Seasoning was purchased as a favor for a bridal shower, to give out to guests as they were leaving.  It was a huge success!!  People were delighted to receive it, and the jar even looked quite pretty decorated with a green bow and set out in a straw basket.  Thank you Amazon and Walkerswood!!<br /><br />BTW, the Amazon suppliers were much more reliable than the actual store that had promised to send us some but sent them very late and after much complaining by us.  Amazon Rocks and Walkerswood Rules!!!"
5,perfect.,I'm on a special diet and I cannot eat cane sugar.  I use stevia and it is delicious.  I add it to fruit smoothies and tea.  It is a lifesaver for me when I need a natural sweetener.
3,Simple To Use,"I've only used Shake N Bake for pork a few times in the past and decided to let my youngest (he's 10) give this a try.  While I supervised, he did all the work which to say isn't too hard.  It didn't come with a bag so we used a ziplock 1 gallon size. The product is simple to use and a quick fix if you're looking for something that requires little prep work.<br /><br />The taste is the same as I remember and would have preferred something a little spicier and not so heavily coated.  The pork was fairly tender but the coating does make it a bit messy. I thought it was okay but doubt I'll get it again."
5,Great Healthy Snack,"I keep these in my desk drawer.  They are my quick breakfast and snack at any time of day.  They taste great, and have nothing but good stuff in them."
5,"Jalapeno Potato Popchips, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)","I love these things.  Makes me feel better not eating preservatives.  I also like the ""kick"" from the jalapeno.  This is my ""cheat"" snack and not bad for 21 chips at 120 calories.  I've gotten other people hooked on these too.  Love 'em"
5,Great bars,These are our favorite bars - not too sweet and all natural. We order them by the bulk every time. The cranberries give them a bit of a tangy flavor which makes them just right. The almonds taste fresh and crunchy. Highly recommend them.
5,Num num num....Delicious!!!,"I can't even tell these are whole grain pancakes!  Better yet, these do not have that<br />stinky raw batter smell that you have with regular pancake mix.  I love foods that<br />are good for me but are not so yucky I have to make myself eat them. I also gave a box<br />to my Mom who is a diabetic so they will not cause a spike in blood sugar. I will never<br />go back to regular pancake mix after tasting these!"
3,it was decent,"This was an impulse buy for me. Turned out to be ok.. I'm more of an energy drink junkie. Didnt really hit the spot. It was a nice change up, but a pack of 24...<br /><br />Tasted like weird soda.."
5,Subtle & smooth,"This is my first chrysanthemum tea, and I enjoy it for a smooth tea.  It goes down easy, with a subtle flavor, and looks great in a glass mug."
4,Good Stuff!,I don't think I'd have this plain with water but it definitely tastes fine in smoothies with fruits and maybe peanut butter. Takes a little getting used to but overall I'd say it's a great product.
5,My Favorite snack,These are definitely my favorite snack.  I am always on the lookout for a healthy alternative to a potato chip and these really fit the bill.  They're so much lower in fat and calories for a LARGE serving size.
5,Great product!,My dogs love it.  It is healthy and nutritious.  You can't go wrong with this.  I highly recommend it
4,Very good Gluten Free pasta.,"It is a good ""al dente "" alternative to rice pasta. Cooks in 7-9 minutes and it doesn't turn into mush when mixed to the sauces. My girl loves it with just Parmigiano and olive oil."
4,Healthy Food For Our Feline Friends,"When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend."
5,Love it!,Best moisturizer I've used thus far. I have dry /sensitive skin and this product takes care of all my needs. I now use it on my seven year old and bought my mom a jar. She loves it also. Great job Alba!
5,Love the smaller bags!,My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch!!! Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores!!! Will definitely be buying more!
5,Wow! Great mixed with Green Tea!,"I like to roast half and half one bag of this with one bag of green tea... I also like potent teas, and this one does have bite! The lemon mellows it out a bit... but the ginger is a nice spicy... good for colds as well as sore throat!"
5,rich flavored chocolate cookies,"These cookies are rich and creamy with a wholesome taste. They don't have a bitter taste like most dark chocolate does, so if you're looking for a traditional bitter taste this is not it. They aren't as soft as bakery cookies, but not crisp as crackers either-they are a medium softness.There are 9 cookies about 1 3/4"" in diameter.<br /><br />The cookies are placed in a plastic container wrapped in a plastic bag within a heavy paper box. I opened a few boxes and looked in the window of the other boxes and none were cracked. I had bought them as Christmas gifts mostly because the current picture shows a red and green box, but I was disappointed that the box was actually orange and pale green. Nevertheless, one of my relatives liked them a lot and so did I."
5,Buffalo Bill's Beef Jerky,"Buffalo Bill's Beef Jerky<br /><br />Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size<br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010<br /><br />Gunner  October, 2009"
5,Soo yummy,Taste exactly like a Caramel Apple. I love after my day sitting & relaxing & enjoying a cup of this amazing hot drink. But if u want it cold it has how u can make it with directions on box
4,Good sampler,"I just bought my first Keurig and wasnt really sure what k-cups to buy since my usual coffee brand doesn't make them.  This has a great variety, but be warned- this contains decaf!  I am no good at reading labels (or anything) before I've had my coffee which made for some interesting mornings.  It really does have a nice variety though."
4,Very Good Coffee,"This is good coffee.  One thing I like about Melita coffees is that they are fine ground, so you can use less when making coffee and they work well with any method of making coffee, not just auto drip.  This is also a very reasonable price for the quality of coffee, much lower than equivalent coffees, especially flavored ones."
2,"Very, very dry turkey jerky, if you like Trader Joe's jerky you won't like this","I ordered the 6 pack of Shelton's Turkey Jerky.  With great anticipation, I opened the first package.  Much to my disappointment, the jerky was quite dry and brittle.  I was hoping for something more like Trader Joe's turkey jerky which is always moist and tasty.  I will eventually eat what I ordered, but unlike the Trader Joe's brand, this stuff will hang around until I'm desperate for anything to munch on."
4,Not bad compared to some local brands,"Although this Basalmic vinegar is good and had a high recommendation from Cooks Illustrated I've had similar quality and taste from a product purchased from Wegmans in Rochester, NY.  It is their brand and has ""4 leafs"" to indicate the quality level.  The price is comparable as well."
5,Delicious and (almost) foolproof to make,"Yes, I know. It seems a bit ridiculous to complain about making Mexican rice - either truly homemade or even the ones in the box. It only takes about 20 minutes. But, usually we're chopping lettuce, shredding cheese, getting everything ready and I forget the rice and it burns. So we bought one of these packets. I admit I was skeptical, but we thought it tasted great. Of course it will taste differently than homemade rice. And no, being a prepared product, it is not going to be the healthiest of choices. But we make most of our meals from scatch so I don't feel guilty about using a prepared product here and there.<br /><br />We've had this rice with tacos, enchiladas, rotel chicken tortilla stack, mexican lasagna, stuffed burritos, and on top of supreme nachos. My only warning is be sure to tear the bag. I was in a hurry one night and put a  bag in and about 40 seconds later, I heard a big BOOM and it had exploded inside the microwave. Sure enough, I'd forgotten to tear the corner open. But for its ease of making, no pots to clean afterwards and how quickly it's ready to eat, I gave it 5-stars."
5,"great taste, allergen free","This is a great product for people with food allergies--it has a great chocolate taste and texture, while being free of major known allergens."
5,Very good quality!,I have tried several different brands. This one is the best with consistency of quality and flavor. I love them!
5,Best dog food.,"Other than a few table scraps, Canidae is the only brand (dry and wet) we feed to our blk lab.  She's done excellent on it and has a very healthy and shinny coat.  People routinely comment how nice her coat looks, most even ask what we feed.  I sent a bag to my brother and he too noticed his dog's coat was healthier looking after a week or two.  I highly recommend this product."
1,Yuck! I just ruined a perfectly good salad!,"Had to eat crackers with my salad to neutralize the taste if this dressing!  If you want no preservatives, make it yourself!"
5,Tully House Blend A++,"Like many, I have cycled through many different brands and k-cups, searching for the perfect blend to satisfy my taste buds.  I prefer a medium roast, but slightly bold.  Tullys House blend fits that bill perfectly for me and my fiance.  The flavor is mild but not flavorless like some other medium blends, and bold enough to wake me up."
3,Nothing special,"This is all right as something to add just a small amount of flavor to water if you really can't stand plain water. It has a fairly strong chemical edge to its flavor, though. It's nice in that the little bottle lends itself well to being able to add however much you want compared to the little packets of powdered flavoring made by other companies that you can't reseal.<br /><br />On the whole, the flavor of the sweet tea version just isn't to the point where I could see myself deliberately seeking this out over other flavoring options."
4,"Good, but not great.","I was looking for a whole wheat muffin and luckily these were available at my local grocer. The texture is very good. I expected them to be super dense like some other wheat muffins I've tried. The flavor was good, but not great. They are better for you than most muffin mixes you get a the grocery. Our palettes aren't used to this type of food. That being said, I will continue buying and eating them. It's worth it to me to be able to get the whole grains, even if I do add a little sugar."
5,Favorite for our family,We purchased Fritt candy in Germany and it quickly became a favorite for all the kids in our immediate and extended family. They love the tart fruity flavor. Anytime someone goes to Germany they bring back 40 plus packages of the fruit flavors and all the kids fight over them. The kids I am talking about are all ages up to 50. They are the highlight of any Christmas gift.
5,Delicious high-sugar cookie,"Pamela's dark chocolate chocolate chunk cookies are delicious thick crisp cookies that will give you a sugar high.  They are very sweet.  If you are wanting a chocolate cookie that is as sweet as candy, look no further!  This one tastes great!  Amazon has them at a great price to sell too as my local Jimbo's sells them for $3.85 for the 5.29 oz box.  They keep fresh a long time.  I have ordered them several times from Amazon and it has been hit-or-miss for fresh unbroken cookies or something suitably to make a pie crust or so stale they are garbage, but Amazon stands behind the order and either replaces or refunds!  Way to go, Amazon!  Thank you!"
4,Good---a chocolaty finish,"This espresso is good tasting and a good deal. I bought this because Green Mountain stopped selling my favorite espresso in the world (even better than Illy!).  So, I figured I would give this a try. IMO, it's not as great as the Green Mountain espresso (but then again, nothing is), but it is definitely a good tasting espresso, and I'll order it again."
1,It's Green for a REASON!  And its not ENVY!,"This is the grossest vile green puree of what looks like a babies rear has been near.... except for the chunks of cottage cheese???  Is that what that stuff was that was more like tofu, also in a nasty green puree... stay away...far, far away!<br /><br />Tell you what if you want to see for yourself, as I have 5 of the 6 packages left.  Send me a SASE and i'll gladly poop it to you ... no problem..."
5,YUM!!,"Oh my gosh, I love Product 19!!  I'm 26 and I remember growing up on this stuff.  I used to ask my mom for it by asking for ""Problem 19"".  It is the best.  It's the healthiest cereal out there with a very unique taste.  But I can't find it anywhere and I was so mad when stores everywhere quit carrying it.  I'm so glad they still sell it here.  I haven't ordered it here before, but I will someday. I think it didn't get many consumers because I don't remember even one commercial on TV for it.  No one I know even remembers this cereal.  But I'm crazy for it."
4,A good sauce for non-mexican food as well!,"Timing is everything in this world! When the bottle of Taco Bell Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce (gee, do you think they could have added a few more descriptive words to the label?) arrived we were having burger night at the house, including fries and a small salad. So, needless to say, we got to use the sauce immediately on a non-Mexican food menu. Our thoughts: the sauce added a bit of zest as a salad dressing. As a dipping sauce for the fries it wasn't a real good combo. It might be due to the addition of salt to the mix. But when added to a hamburger in place of ketchup I found it a great change of pace. Throw a few onions on it as well and I really enjoyed the burger (in fact I had two which I really not suppose to do on my diet).<br /><br />As for the accuracy of the label description, it is not what I would call BOLD, definitely not overpowering a taste. It is a very creamy sauce with a good consistency to it. But it is not very spicy in my opinion which I feel is ok. A lot of the time I find that increasing the heat of a sauce is at the expense of the taste. I think this could have been a wee bit hotter but since I find the flavor enjoyable it's not a problem.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the taste. It is something that I will purchase for many different types of food. In fact I'm kind of wondering how it would be mixed into a meatloaf. Hmm, that may be my next menu for it."
5,Mmmmmm.....,"I tried this tea in the mall at the Teavana store and it is AMAZING! And that's coming from someone who doesn't normally like tea. I loved it so much I had to buy it, I don't regret buying it in the slightest. It's delicious!"
5,SUGARTWINBROWNSUGAR,THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT.  KEEPS MY HUSBAND'S DIABETES UNDER CONTROL WHILE STILL BEING ABLE TO HAVE A TREAT.  I WISH IT WERE AVAILABLE IN OUR GROCERY STORES - ONLY THE WHITE IS AVAILABLE.
4,"Good tasty soup, 9 servings","I had to buy this to be sure what 9 pockets in 3 packs meant. LOL Good soup, stronger than Sushi Chef (which is what was available at my local store). I would look for a better price before I ordered again."
5,WONDERFUL COFFEE,"We have been ordering this coffee from coffee bean direct for years all their coffee is well worth it, this one is just our favorite. Was so excited when amazon started selling it now i get great coffee without shipping can't get any better than that. If you love great coffee you will love this!!!"
4,corn puffs,"I was surprised how good this cereal was, with or without milk.  It is something I eat by itself or mixed with other cereals.  I recommend it for those who are looking for a healthy cereal or snack."
4,good product,Was not disappointed in this product. Taste good and not too salty and provide a good crunch. I would recommend to others.
5,Yum yum,Absolutely very tasty chips. The best I have ever had. Very flavorful. Just like the UK Salt and Vinegar crisps I had over there.
5,"yes, it's THAT good","the salted almonds dark chocolate chocolove is the BEST chocolate bar e v e r.  something about the combination of sweet & salty flavors is unbelievable, and I am huge dark chocolate fan.  The dark chocolate isn't so dark that's it's bitter.  I was hesitant to try this at first, but now that I did, it's my favorite hands down.  Have given it to several friends as a little gift and they are all equally turned on to this bar.  high recommend!"
5,My Dream Product,"I came across this product on Amazon while scouting for healthy Asian products for my cooking show.<br />I was so thrilled to find and tried Happy Pho.  Happy Pho is my ""dream Vietnamese product"".  What makes Happy Pho my dream kitchen product/condiment?  Firstly, because our family loves eating Pho, we don't mind eating Pho every few days (especially when it's chilly outside).  Pho is the stable food in our home and I believe it is in most Vietnamese homes too. Secondly, Happy Pho is my ""dream comes true product"" because not only it made with the best ingredients for its kind (i.e. gluten free, brown rice noodles, organic spices, low sodium, and no MSG),  but it's also tasty and easy to make.  Lastly, Happy Pho is very low in calories per serving and it's even ""printed on 100% recycled paperboard"" :). If you want a more fancy Pho, I would recommend adding your favorite vegetables, baked tofu, or grilled chicken for more nutritious nutrients.<br /><br />I am a Registered Dietitian, therefore I know the great benefits of eating complex carbohydrate/high fiber foods such as Happy Pho, especially something that you eat on a regular basis.<br />I hope that Happy Pho will continue to make more similar Asian products as Happy Pho that are tasty, healthy and are quick and easy to make.<br /><br />I'm planning to buy more Happy Pho for myself and for my friends and family to try as well."
3,Stale coffee,"I just bought two three packs of Starbucks coffee on a similar deal.  Both were six months past the ""best by"" date on the bag.  I wasn't expecting ""just"" roasted coffee, but the flavor was definitely not what it should have been."
5,the other bergamot,"The red variety of bee balm is also called bergamot. I grow Bee Balm myself and the fragrance is the same as what is known as Earl Grey tea. As with any herb, it spreads fast, and has a variety of medicinal uses. For more information, search Bee Balm. Try growing this wonderful perennial and see if you don't enjoy the fragrance, if not the other uses. This tea is wonderful."
1,Disappointed,"This is the third time I've ordered the flavored sampler, and in the 24 K-Cups, about 10 of them are hot chocolate!  When you're ordering for your office, and expect a coffee sampler but get a majority of hot chocolate, it's very disappointing!  I guess there's no way to confirm what flavors they decide to throw in your box."
5,G=r=e=a=t STUFF.  It works!,"Bedtime Tea Is the ""icing on the cake"" for me.  It has become part of my bedtime ritual now.  It adds just that little 'extra' that my system needs to sleep more soundly.  I have to tell you that taking two 'Calcium-Magnesium-Zinc pills are crucial for me.  The magnesium really does calm down the nervous system, and don't drink coffee at 11 a.m., but since I found Bedtime Tea, I don't go anywhere without it.  I order 6-12 boxes at a time.  Good Stuff."
3,Too smokey for Montreal smoked meat,"As an ex-Montrealer, I found the meat to be too smokey compared to true Montreal smoked meat.  However, the quality of the meat was excellent, and the meat packages were packed extremely well and shipped quickly."
5,best vegetarian chili,"This is simply the best vegetarian chili available. Totally delicious, the meat substitute is delicious. Sprinkle a little grated cheese on top, heat up a soft tortilla, and dig in."
1,"Disgusting Artificial Sweeteners in All Sodastream, even non-diet",I squinted on the product picture and made out that sugar was the first ingredient as one would hope in a non-diet drink flavoring. Imagine my frustration when I discovered Splenda and acesulfame potassium among other chemicals I choose not to ingest! Why offer a diet version and non-diet version if everything has nasty artificial sweeteners?
1,Are you serious?,At this price and you expect to sell these?... You have to be kidding!  This has got to be a joke?
5,Easy to make and delicious!,"I usually cook soup from scratch and rarely use canned or dry soup. However, sometimes in the dead winter or cool spring, I long for a bowl of hot soup but too lazy to drive out and shop for fresh ingridients. After reading great reviews about the Bob's Red Mill soup mix, I decided to try it for those special occasions.<br /><br />The reviews were all true. The soup mix is easy to use, delicious, fullfilling, and nutritious. I sautee some onions and garlic which are constant stables in my pantry. When I have leftover baked ham, I would freeze them and use the in this soup. Then I add water and the soup mix, bring to a boil, cover and turn off the stove. After a while or overnight, turn on the stove and stir the pot once in a while to prevent sticking. Cook until desired consistency. I only add pepper, but some people may prefer to salt the soup.<br /><br />One reviewer online suggested making a larger portion and freeze leftover to save cooking time. I tried it and found the leftover as good as a new pot once reheated on stove. Try this soup with bread or any meal. Delicious!"
1,YUK,don't waste your money this tastes awful I thought it would be a good quick meal to take to work but it has this werid taste and its rubber texture is gross...I can't beleive I paid $12.00 for this
5,The best stuff in the world,This is by far the best thing ever!! It taste fantastic and goes well with everything. I found myself making excuses to eat it on everything I possibly could. Personally I find it to be the most addictive thing I ever tasted. The smell alone is reason enough to buy it.
5,"Great food, Great price, and no more food allergies!!!","My cat had the worst food allergies. The way she dealt with it was by vomiting on an almost daily basis. Getting special foods (i.e. Science Diet or Purina from the veterinarian) didn't help at all. Finally I tried Newman's Own dry food figuring it couldn't be any worse. It worked like a miracle! No more allergies and no more carpet cleaning except the occasional hairball. When my cat got older I started supplementing her dry food with the Newman's Own wet food and she loves it. She's been eating this for several years, same flavor and everything, and she still comes running when she hears the food being prepped. If you want a healthy pet don't look any further than this! It's organic and there isn't a single ingredient that I can't pronounce. That's definitely something I want when I'm feeding my cat.<br /><br />The price through Amazon.com is cheaper than buying in the stores and the cans come well packaged and undamaged. I won't be going to the store for this again. Thanks Amazon!"
5,MY FAVORITE TEA,"This is delicious tea, with or without milk and/or sugar. I drink it for breakfast, lunch, dinner and iced on hot summer afternoons. I drink the decaf version with midnight snacks. IMO, this tea tastes every bit as good as the English Breakfast tea from Peet's or Starbuck's. I use a ""strainer"" (infuser)  with very small holes, like the Teeli Brew Basket or Swissgold Tea Filter. Amazon sells both. Get it wet before you put in the tea. Enjoy your cuppa!"
5,the proof in truly in the pudding (Newman's Own- Chriken formula),"""Only my hair dresser knows for sure,""  Well I don't know about that, but the folks at Amazon know how much cat food I order (on account), both dry & wet foods.  Before I even offered Newman's Own Organic Chicken & Brown Rice formula to my five cats, I could see the difference.  Upon openind the first can, I was so pleased to see real chicken broth (organic of course). It was clear broth just like boiling chicken on stove top. It was really fresh looking too., So then the real test when offering to the three indoor cats.  All three approved.  I given only small portions at one time, yet my kitties cleaned the bowl, eating right up!  Never, ever do I recall when my kitties have been so accepting of their wet food. I've owned and cared for cats for over 25 years, and this food really impresses me! I now order it via ""Subscribe & Save"" (Amazon program) and it will be delivered at regular intervals.  The first case was damaged in shipment (3 or 4 cans were damaged so bad that the contents were running and dripping from the carton. I contacted Amazon and they were gracious as usual and are sending a new case for my accomodation. The only concern I have at this time is that this particular formula is ""out of stock"" and currently not available from Amazon, though it can be purchased from WAG.com.  I also make purchases from WAG.com and though their prices are slightly higher (most of the time), they are also a great company and have a good variety of foods for both Cats & Dogs, as well as other pet items.<br /><br />If you've never read Newman's Own QA report and product description, be sure to do so. I think you'll be impressed. I was."
5,Michoko Candies,"I originally got these candies from a relative who was in Paris. Subsequently, I bought them while in Paris. They are a delicious chocolate candy, perfect for a fast chocolate fix."
5,artesanal peanut butter,"Yeah, I know i spelled artesanal wrong, but too lazy to look it up. PB & Co in NYC is awesome, and I visited the store all the time when I lived in Greenwich Village. I am currently backpacking and these packets are excellent for on the go. I highly recommend for hikers and other travelers as they provide protein, calories, energy, etc. Otherwise, if you buy the jars, this is a great flavor, but slightly better are the white chocolate and the maple syrup (very best)."
1,Stale,"I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this..."
5,"No aftertaste, no need to stir",I've tried a lot of artificial sweeteners and several brands of Stevia and this is my favorite.  There is no need to stir it like some with extra fiber and there is no aftertaste like many artificial sweeteners.
5,Absolutely delicious and satisfying,"This item came up in a gold box recommendation and I took a chance.  While a bit more expensive than the Cliff Bars I had been buying, these were an absolute treat and I plan to purchase more.  The all-natural raw foods approach makes for the best snack bar I've ever had - delicious, not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner.  I tried the chocolate version and found it a little too dry for my taste, but similarly well flavored."
5,My dogs love this stuff!,"This stuff is great!  All 3 of my dogs love this dog food and they have all been on it for 2 years now without a problem.  The ingredients are very high quality too.  My sister and my parents have all started feeding their dogs Blue Buffalo too, and all of their dogs love it as well.  I don't have a single complaint about this dog food."
1,Did not care for this coffee at all,I was really hoping to like this coffee because the price was right and I liked that I could have it delivered on regular intervals.  The coffee did not have a good taste at all and left a horrible after taste. It also gave me heartburn. I will only buy Green Mountain kcups from here on in.
5,The Best,"We like this cereal so much that we have subscribed.  Now we not only enjoy this cereal but we save money.  By subscribing to a monthly delivery (I sound like a commercial, don't I) we save 70 cents a box from what it cost at our local grocer and then that's only when we can find it on his shelf which isn't often enough.  So it comes to our door for less.  It tastes so good and is truly healthful."
1,Made in China,"I thought I was doing my dogs good - paying what, $8 or $9 for one bag at the pet store. Then it was brought to my attention in a review here on amazon that this product is ""made in China."" Probably takes the slave labor there a month to earn that much. Will never buy this product again. Buy Healthy Happy Pet, Snook's instead."
4,"Tastes like Redbull, doesn't look so much like Redbull and smells a little vitaminy","First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull. When I burp, it has the similar energy drink belch smell that energy drinks have for some reason. The color is not quite the same as Redbull.<br /><br />But having said all that I still find this to be an excellent value when you compare the prices of Redbull vs this mixture. At the store, Redbulls are $1.99 where as this one costs maybe $0.40 after all is said and done (cost of carbonation, syrup, shipping charged on carbonation, etc). I made that number up in my head though, did not use a calculator or even really think mathmatically about it so it is pretty much a made up cost I pulled out of the air and doesn't represent anything truthfully.<br /><br />Anyhow, I know it is a much cheaper solution, I enjoy it and am drinking some now. Meow."
5,Great jerky from Tillamook!,"We love Tillamook's old fashioned silver dollar jerky and this is just as good, in fact, my wife actually prefers this to the old fashioned.  I'm split-I love both just the same.  We love everything about Tillamook products, and have visited their creamery/factory in Oregon a few times.  It's worth the trip from Minnesota, just to get their ice cream cones.  We haven't found any Tillamook jerky in retail stores out here, so we will be ordering more."
5,Jasmine Rice,Great rice! I usually use rice cooker and make sticky rice. This is perfect for that. Plus it has nice smell and tastes fantastic. Gotta love Jasmine. This is great quality at a very reasonable price.
4,Tasty coffee,An excellent addition to my flavoured Keurig selection for late night when I want a cup before going to bed. The vanilla flavour is subtle (other flavours I have are stronger) but it works for a late-night treat.
3,"Strong but flat, lacking definition","These k-cups are certainly bold and strong, but the finish is flat and thin.  It's lacking in overtones after the inital dark wave.  I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week.  Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are.  I wanted something dark and rich in texture.  But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish."
5,I missed this stuff so much!,"My mother used to make pork with shake n bake quite a lot and I loved it then and rediscovered it here! It cooks in 15 minutes at 425 degrees in the oven, which is the quickest oven meal I've made.  Shake 'n Bake makes the pork crispy and stays pretty crispy as a left over.  If you haven't tried it please do, it will be on your regular menu for a long time."
5,The Only Pretzels I Want,"These Snyder's of Hanover Olde Tyme Pretzels are the only pretzels I want, I love everything about them. The size of these are one size down from the largest bagged size and are very lightly salted, which I enjoy very much. The texture is not rock-hard like some other larger pretzels I've had; rather, when you bite into one of these, it has a flakey, slightly (but pleasantly) crumbly texture that is easy to chew. The flavor is mild and just plain good. I enjoy making chocolate covered pretzels once or twice a year during holidays for my family as well as bundle up packages of regular and white chocolate pretzels as treats to give away, and everyone enjoys them. I have found these pretzels are also very good when one is getting over a sick tummy because they are so mild. I never cared very much for pretzels before until I tried this brand and have been buying them ever since!"
4,delicious,"Popcorn is very delicious.  However, some of the packages have been very oily and thus make grasping them to put in my popcorn maker a task."
5,Rudy's favorite,"I don't know why, but lately I've had trouble finding these IAMS dog biscuits in the local grocery stores.  Since my German Shepherd loves them, I searched Amazon and found this Pack of 6 deal.  Rudy is happy.  His teeth are staying clean and all is good!"
5,Happy with my Turmeric,"I actually bought this for two reasons--some to use in cooking but to grow as well.  It's too early to say if it will grow, but several of the roots looked viable for planting and it was fresh.  Good stuff, very anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant."
4,Unique Flavor,"This is a very unique product. The taste is different, but very good. I'm addicted to them. My mother had these when I was a kid, so they are not only an excellent, unique hard candy, but they are also a childhood memory for me."
5,Plump Pilchards,"Everyone knows that Portuguese sardines are the best.<br /><br />Everyone, that is, except the sardines themselves, when they stray into Spanish territorial waters off the coast of Galacia, just north of Portugal.<br /><br />That's where these were nabbed. So while technically our conquistadores are Spanish, for all practical intents and purposes you can consider them Portuguese.<br /><br />Certainly, that's how they taste, and at a price significantly lower than you would pay for their cousins just across the border.<br /><br />Furthermore, these fish are presented in a decidedly upscale fashion. As we learn from the back of the carton, ""Artisan fishing methods, old master cannery know-how and the highest quality ingredients produce a sardine that is moist, tender, and uncommonly flavorful"".<br /><br />In addition, they are ""hand packed"" and ""100 % natural"".<br /><br />After all this my stomach's rumbling. Bring `em on!"
1,Buyer Beware...read,Do not buy this if you think this will substitute your current uses of PB. I love PB found nothing this mixes with well or betters the taste. I Iove Amazon but ask these 5* ratings be investigated and following up that my review remains published.
5,Wonder-full supplement,"Fenugreek seed helps with digestion if you are not a new mother and breastfeeding.  From what I observed, my digestion became more evenly spaced over time, and I was hungry for food later than without taking the fenugreek.  I did not take the supplement regularly, however, and gave it to my sister who breastfeeds.  I can report her good news that the product works wonders for mothers and babies.  If you are a new mother and want an abundance of milk at your baby's feedings, I recommend this product and brand to you."
3,"Not instant, but not real","I like one cup of coffee in the afternoon at work and I want it strong.  With Via I can make one cup of decent coffee quickly.  It's also a good product to take traveling.  It's so much better than restaurant coffee but you don't pay the ridiculous price you can pay at a Starbucks. It's a huge improvement over instant coffee, but it's not equal to the real thing.  Honestly, I think it deserves 3 1/2 stars."
5,Excellent Product,"I usually find these at my local health food store.  It's a great, tasty product, which I think most people would enjoy.<br /><br />They are great for entertaining when you have family over or friends."
2,Old and tough,I will not likely order again. The product was old and past the pull date by 2 months.
5,This stuff rocks!,"Since I have started feeding Sojos Grain Free to my two 10 and 12 yr old poodles, I have noticed that they are very enthusiastic about their food, their coats look better, and my 10 yr old Standard who was a poop eater has shown much less interest in doing that.  She also used to have near daily episodes of urping up undigested food, and that has totally stopped. They also have nicer breath, and less gas.  I add poached chicken or raw beef, canned salmon, eggs or cottage cheese to the mix.  The result does look and smell like I could eat it myself.  I supplement with a probiotic and enzyme powder, and salmon oil.  My only complaint is that it is expensive.  So, I just remind myself of how much time, energy and money I save not having to shampoo my rugs constantly!"
5,Delicious Mango flavor,"Full of great Mango flavor, perfect for Mango Iced Tea. My local espresso shop uses Monin syrups and I purchased to make my own."
5,great stuff,"i purchased this for my father for christmas & though the packaging is not all i could wish (many packets crammed into a box) the quality is exceptional, the product is fresh & the decaf bit does not make it taste any different from regular earl grey, the price was wonderfull & i will be sending more to my father when he runs low, you can not go wrong to order this product if you love earl grey or know someone who does"
5,Very tasty tea,"When I bought this I didn't think it would be so tasty. This tea has a very flavorful, sweet, natural taste. I am a big tea drinker and always hunt for a new taste and this is definitely at the top of my list."
5,Grown up flavors,"Crystal light Mojito flavor brings the sweet and tart flavor of Mojito to a non alcoholic drink mix that will be a great change of pace to the iced teas and fruit punches we usually drink. Each small pouch makes two quarts. The drink is mildly sweet with a fresh mint flavor, which tastes very natural and not artificial. Very tasty and good."
5,"Delicious, decadent food bar",Buy at Walmart 4/$4.27 cheaper than Amazon. A little more expensive than some other similar bars and well worth it. The quality and taste is exceptional. More like a dessert with nutrition and real ingredients. The cherry / cashew ones are wonderful too.
4,Scores well for what it is,"There are so many dark chocolate bars out these days from all over the world.  Many claim to be delicious as well as healthy.  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar seems worthy of praise even though the percent of dark chocolate is somewhat low compared to others. However, it has a creaminess and flavor that are above some dark bars.<br /><br />The waxiness of some chocolate bars is overly apparent, but Newman's is soft without the waxy feel.  It melts nicely in your mouth and because it's organic, it makes you feel like you're eating something that may be good for you.  People worry about additives, pesticides, etc. and this product, being organic, seems to avoid all the bad stuff.  Of course, it is a bit higher in fat than most dark chocolate bars, but if you don't mind that, the taste is good.<br /><br />The size of the bar is a bit small, 2.25 ounce, the price is about the same for other similar products.  On the other hand, a smaller bar is probably better than buying a large size one and devouring all of it.  I think it's a delicious tasting dark chocolate and I would probably buy it again."
5,My Cats Love This!,I was stunned at how much my cats love these Whiskas Temptations.  Some of the other flavors weren't so thrilling but this one is a winner.
1,Awful,"I am really disappointed with this chocolate. It tasted cheap and not worth $5, let alone the $30+ I paid for it. Lindor Truffles would have been better for my mother for mother's day, rather than this cheap, gritty junk. Don't waste your money."
5,Excellent and useful pantry staple,"I've been buying this by the case on subscribe & save, and have found this to be really useful.  I can simply make it up per the directions, and it makes a quick tasty lunch that gives me energy for hours.  love the sliced nuts in it - gives it some crunch).  I keep a case of it at work for lunch breaks.  When I'm home, I experiment with it by cooking up a cup, and then mixing it with noodles, soups, chili, eggs, whatever I'm trying to use up that is in the refrigerator.  I really like mixing a cooked up cup of this with a packet of the pre-cooked organic quinoa that I also buy through Amazon's subscribe & save, that's an excellent vegetarian protein combination, and digests really well, gives me energy to get through my work day afternoon.  The spice packet that comes with this product is quite nippy (for my Irish heritage taste bud setup) so I use 3/4 of it when I eat it just out of the cup, but works perfectly when I mix it with anything else.  It's a great product, and inexpensive, and easy to prepare, just add water to the paper cup it comes in and microwave.  I keep several cases (6 cups) in the pantry."
5,Great Buy!!!  By buying in bulk and auto-ship it cuts the cost down to approx. 0.62 per bag!  Cost in stores is $1.00,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6XR0S"">Barbara's Bakery Oatmeal Wheat Free Snackimals Animal Cookies,  2.125 Ounce Bags (Pack of 18)</a>"
5,Better Than Sex Cookies,"These cookies are the best ""high"" that I can remember! I am a senior citizen!  It's hard to believe they're good for you too.  The crisp almond-cranberry combination uniquely make them ""Addictive!"" I almost cried when I was told at Costo that they didn't sell them any more."
2,Weak uneventful coffee,This Green Mountain French Vanilla Decaf is weak coffee and lacks the taste of other French Vanilla coffee. The best I could do with this is brew it at a 6-oz cup to give it some flavor. I cannot wait until it's gone and I can try another decaf. Don't settle for this coffee when you have other choices available.
5,Dogs like them,"My dogs think these Chicken Zuke's Minis are really tasty. The only problem for me is that the treats are so tiny, that my 90lb German Shepherd swallows them as if they're dust. They're excellent for a smaller dog, I just wish they were slightly larger for the bigger kids in the playground."
5,Tastes like regular pasta!,"This pasta has all the taste of regular pasta, but none of the gluten.  A person wouldn't be able to tell that it isn't regular pasta upon eating it, and that's really the most important part."
3,Dents in 2 of the tins when arrived,"This cocoa is like any other cocoa, other than it is white and turns pink when touches liquid.  The tin is cute, but 2 cans were dented when they arrived. Not sure if it was from shipping or the seller.  A bit over priced in my opinion as well."
5,Delicious,"This is just absolutely fantastic tea!  The mint flavor is so pure and refreshing and there is not much sugar in the drink.  It's also completely USDA Organic, QAI Organic,Halal, and Kosher & Pareve - this is a drink that is truly good for you.  For one 12oz bottle there are 60 calories, 5mg sodium, 0 fat, 15g carbs, 14g sugar, and 0g protein.  Numi also donates 1% of net profits to benefit social, environmental & sustainable causes.  I highly recommend this, along with the rest of Numi's Puerh line of bottled teas."
2,Less is not More,"I recently changed over from dry to wet food for my cats.  Trying to find a grain, veggie and fruit free food is not easy, cats are obligate carnivores remember and don't need that stuff (do the research).  I thought I found it in this chicken product.  However, when I opened the can I noticed lots of fluid and potato starch. After spilling out the liquid and rinsing off the potato starch (why is that there anyway? A filler?) The can lost 2 oz. of weight.  With the prices of cat food going up and up, I want more not less.  Don't misunderstand me, this is a fairly good product, a little low in fat, but the cats love it just the same. I just want the company to know if they say its 5.5 oz. then don't pump it up with junk to save a few pennies.  Consumers are not stupid."
5,My dog loves Cesar Grilled Chicken,"I had looked for years for something that my dog would eat more than a few times. One time I checked out the Cesar Grilled Chicken and he eats it without fail. Although he will not eat any other flavor, I am happy I found the one he will eat."
5,recipes for Cheez-it crumbs?,"Cheez-it's are awesome, so I'm just going to give the rating for that. However, there is potential for breakage. I don't know if my UPS guy was in a bad mood that day or what, but my Cheez-it's are 4 boxes of crumbs. I'm thinking of making crunchy,cheesy chicken fingers for the kids with them. They are too broken up to eat them otherwise."
5,The best of the best,"We have been trying many different brands of coconut oil recently and will be hard pressed to buy anything other than Nutiva from now on.  It has a very fresh smell & taste that is far superior to any other brand we have tried.  The economical one gallon tub will last quite a while, but since it does not need to be refrigerated after opening, it will be quite at home in the pantry  :)"
5,GREAT BUY,When you have kids that eat cereal day and night.  This is a great deal...The boxes came in perfect conditions.
5,Great steaks,These were cheaper than the omamhasteaks website that i usually buy them from<br />great deal for the holidays to ship off to that special someone in your family that likes steak
3,too strong,"This tea  was way too strong for my palate, you might like it. I received it on time,<br />no issues with shipping and packaging but I mixed it with other teas to lessen the strong flavor and I finally ended up trowing away the unused portion, very strong smell, almost like perfumed.<br />If you are looking for a subtle taste, you might want to try something else."
5,Love it!,"This stuff is wonderful.  I like carbonated drinks, but not the sweetness or all the strange ingredients.  I use this with a very small amount of syrup or lemon juice and it's great!"
5,Yummy!,"These are a nice, light alternative to ordinary potato chips. To me, they have a sort of buttery flavor. They're crunchy, a little sweet, and not the least bit greasy. My husband took some to work and they were a huge hit with his coworkers. In fact, he had none left for himself!"
4,natural vitality.  natural calm raspberry lemon flavor,NATURAL CALM is a great relaxing magnesium supplement.  This product will balance your calcium intake and restore healthy magnesium levels. This product also helps reduce stress after a hard days work!  Use as derected.
5,Consistent Service,We always order our coffee KCUPS from Gloria Jeans and experience quick deliveries.  Quality of the product is never an issue and is what we expect
5,Fantastic,"Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down. Tastes amazing and priced fairly, what more could you ask for?"
5,Simply the best!,"Let me start off by saying that I seldom write reviews for products, even if I think they're terrific. This has more to do with the fact that I generally wait to see which way the wind is blowing before I jump in. Not so with Quinn Popcorn. I was one of the lucky group that happened upon their Kickstarter campaign and I couldn't be happier about it. We received our mixed case about two weeks ago and every time we want a snack we have to weigh the desire for an amazingly tasty treat with our limited supply. Is it really a ""popcorn worthy"" movie/episode/? Now that it will be available through amazon we will no longer be forced to resort to less tasty or more processed options. I think you probably get the idea by now that we are fans. Let me finish with some actual critique of the product. The flavors are excellent and the preparation is simple. Truly a great product well worth your snack money."
4,Convenient coffee,"These are the same coffee pods I used to purchase at my local grocery store. Standard coffee. Can't really go wrong with Maxwell House. And it saves having to mess with coffee filters.<br /><br />I only wish they came in flavors, LOL."
5,Love it,"I purchased this, altho hesitant, for my Mother for Mother's Day.  I considered sending flowers, but when I stumbled across this, I thought I'd give it a shot.  She was very happy w/ the bonsai.  It had two blooms on it when she opened it on Tuesday.  Today is Friday and she called to tell me in now has 3 more blooms!  No dead leaves, very well packaged.  My Aunt now wants one as well!"
5,Served its purpose,I do not really like tea but I needed to drink it for medical reasons.  Shipping was really fast and the price was good.  I am sure those who like Sage Tea would love it.
5,Pacific comfort,"The Pacific Chai Latte mixes, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDMVNY"">Pacific Chai Vanilla Chai Latte Mix, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a>, are delicious and mix easily in hot water.  I have a large cup in the morning and a decaffeinated cup in the afternoon.  It's next to impossible to find in the supermarkets, and when I do find it it is much more expensive than the Amazon price.  I like the variety of flavors, but I usually choose the vanilla chai latte.  I highly recommend it for a comforting warm drink without too much caffeine."
5,Love These Artichokes,"If you like artichokes, do yourself a favor and order some.  Simply delicious!  Use for salads, soups, dips, casseroles.  Could no longer find within 100 miles, so it saves us a long trip."
5,cats love this product,"The Weruva cat food, Mack and Jack from Amazon smells good enough for humans,  we envy our 2 cats their food! :D  The cats bury their little noses in the can and just love their food.  Thank you.  Cece in the U.P."
4,THESE ARE VERY GOOD,"These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.<br /><br />The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier."
5,Better than Bigelow,"I love all teas  - hot, cold, you name it. When I'm in the mood for a mint tea, I select Bigelow Mint Medley. I find it has a nice smooth mint flavor. Since that is the mint tea I usually drink, I wondered how Yogi would compare to it.<br /><br />The two teas have different ingredients. Bigelow's ingredients are peppermint leaves, spearmint leaves, rose hips, lemon peel, hibiscus. Yogi is organic peppermint leaf, organic Assam black tea leaf, organic spearmint leaf, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, green tea extract, organic black pepper, kola nut, guarana seed, organic clove bud, stevia leaf.<br /><br />I seeped both teas for the same amount of time - approximately 5 minutes (Bigelow recommends seeping for 3-5 minutes. Yogi recommends 4-6 minutes). After seeping, looking at the 2 cups of tea, the Yogi tea is darker -you can tell that there is some black tea included. Both teas are aromatic - the Mint Medley has a nice soft mint smell. Yogi smells like mint, however, it has a more complex smell - there's a hint of cinnamon and it smells a bit sweeter than the Mint Medley. Taste-wise, both teas have a nice mint flavor, however, I found the Yogi tea just had more depth to it: as a tea drinker I can taste that there's black tea included in the blend. There's also a mild tingly sensation after drinking the tea (very very mild tingling). Overall, I found the Yogi tea tasted better and I enjoyed it more.<br /><br />I don't know the accuracy of its claims to get your chi moving. However, this is a great tasting mint tea."
1,Smells and tastes like Big Red,"This tea is just disgusting. The rooibos and cinnamon are organic, but they add ""natural flavors"" to this product and it ends up tasting fake, like the way Big Red gum tastes like. Very disappointing."
5,Great product!,"This kit is perfect for those of you who are new to home brewing or thinking about upgrading from a smaller batch size fermenter.  It is just as easy to use as some of the smaller size begginer home brew kits, but it has a few more advanced tools that really let you customize and create better home brewed beer.  The products that come with the kit all seem to be of high quality and everything arrived packed neatly and in good shape. The instructions are very easy to follow and guide you every step of the way. It really isn't much harder to use than the smaller 2 gallon begginner kits. The instructions teach you the process with an easy basic, but tasty, brew. It then gives you a recipe for most of the major styles of beer.  All you will need is an ingredient kit, a big pot to brew in, bottles, and a few utensils to cook with and this kit will have all you need to make great beer.  Cheers!"
3,Snack Bar,"Wasn't crazy about the Corazonas Oatmeal Squares, Peanut Butter Bar!  It tastes okay, but quite dense.  I will not buy this item again.  A friend of mine tried one and she liked it, but also wasn't crazy about it."
5,Great flour at a great price,I purchased this flower to try and to see if there was a big difference in the Caputo flour for pizza.....there is a huge difference in taste and form ability.  It is worth the money!!

3,Just ok,"This drink had a strong taste of ginger and a little bit of honey and lemon.  I found the ginger was almost over powering.  This was mostly ok, I would drink it if someone gave it to me but I don't think I would bother to purchase it.  You could probably get the same effect with lemon zinger tea, a little bit of real honey and some dry ginger powder and it would cost a fraction of the price of this."
5,5-hour energy,I just had twins in December.  How do I make it through the workday?????  5-hour energy.  Enough said.
5,A most excellent soda!!,"Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />I've tried most flavors of Ramune before, but I had never tried the lychee flavor until I brought some home this past Christmas. The lychee flavor is really difficult to describe. It's sort of like a cross between strawberry and pear, but there is really no Western analog to the taste. You just have to try it for yourself and judge.<br /><br />It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink."
5,pecan pie larabars,"these are awsome....my four year olds love them.  They are an easy snack to take on the go that is nutritious without gluten, sugar or worries:)"
5,great ingredient,Hard to find this product.  So excited to receive; it makes the best soup and can be used in many recipes.
5,Healthy treat,"I had been feeding mostly the chicken jerky treats, feeling good about it since the only ingredient was chicken.  Then I saw the reports of kidney failure linked to the ones made in China.  It's hard to find them made in the USA, and they are much more expensive.  Then I found these.  They are made in the US.  Ingredients are chicken and Vitamin E.  The texture is different, but my dog likes them just as well and they have the added advantage of being ""breakable"", so you can give them smaller portions easily."
4,"Not 5-star, but very good","Not quite the extremely-soft (almost gooey) fresh Medjools I remember enjoying in California, but pretty close. Overall, really good dates at a good price."
4,The best flavor,"The blend of flavor is fantastic for this olive oil seasoning for bread dipping.  I also add this to pita bread with a bit of olive oil and put in the toaster over for a great treat and also mix with olive oil, parsley flakes and a bit of S&P and toss this with boiled potatoes for a great side dish.<br />The only downside is that it's a bit pricey but so flavorful that a little goes a long way. They do not ship to Puerto Rico so I did have to ship it to a friend who then sent it to me thus adding additional costs."
1,YUCK!,"HAS TWO TIMES THE FILLING OF FIG NEWTONS WHICH MAKES THEM TOO GOOEY AND STICK TOGETHER.  HAVE PURCHASED BARBARA;S PRODUCTS BEFORE AND LIKED THEM, BUT WOULD NOT BUY THE BLUEBERRY BARS AGAIN. TASTE AWFUL."
3,A Creamy Delicious Sauce Great For Dipping,"Yeah, Taco Bell isn't exactly associated with healthy living. While it may say Taco Bell on the label the sauces are actually manufactured by Kraft Foods. They pay Taco Bell to slap their name on the label and voila you get a more recognizable brand. The sauce is pretty typical. It's tangy, creamy with a little extra spice to it. Great for dipping. Try it out if your a fan of the flavor."
1,NOT GLUTEN FREE!,"After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.<br /><br />For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:<br />1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.<br />2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.<br />3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.<br />In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!<br />Don't eat Nana's products!<br /><br />Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites."
5,good stuff,"Makes great bread. I've been using 2/3 of this to 1/3 white bread flour for fine results. It's a big bag for a household,but I broke it up into 1 gallon freezer bags and freeze it. Highly recommended."
5,great!,does what it is supposed to!  works for the irregular shapes of the mike n ike candies as well as for the gum pieces.
5,Truly Rich,"This is truly rich and satisfying cup of coffee. I have been drinking it for years. It is truly equal to the best coffee I have tasted in any coffee shop.Another surprise is that is always consistent from order to order. My newest favorite coffee is now the Emerels Big Easy. Just a tad richer with a wonderful aftertaste. I will be alternating these two wonderful blends, for years to come."
3,Just average catnip and might be stale!,"My 2 cats like this catnip but nothing ""crazy"" or weird went on, they just rolled around and rubbed their faces in it (one even ate some). Nothing different from regular catnip. Actually I had another brand that produced crazier reactions like drooling and hyperactivity. Can't remember the brand tho.<br /><br />And I smelled the stuff and it seemed stale, the date on the back said copyright 2004! This is 2008! Maybe if you get a fresher batch it will be craziness all around."
5,love this coffee,I love Starbucks coffee of all kinds but the Pikes Place is my all time favorite it is so smooth and rich it is the perfect coffee for the person who likes to drink their coffee black
5,Can't wait to try it,"A handy box with 6 Indian curry's, takes up little space in cupboard. Like I said..can't wait to try them out and experience the awesome Indian flavors and pleasant smells again... If you never ate Indian food, please give it a try, it's not 'scary' or 'weird,' it's very tasty."
5,Makes a good cup of coffee,I was given a keurig B70 as a gift and was asked which coffee sample type(s) I wanted with it.<br /><br />I decided to take a chance on this one.  It was a good choice.<br /><br />The coffee was smooth and full bodied.<br /><br />An excellent french roast.
5,It's the greatest!,"Seven Seas Dressing, Viva Italian is the greatest salad dressing I've ever tasted! And I've had a variety of salad dressings. It's the best, hands down."
4,Purina is always the leader,"I will have to admit that I don't take a lot of heed to the food I give to my dogs.  Typically, they simply aren't show, work or hunting dogs, so I'm not typically concerned about it. I will have to say that since introducing my pet to Beneful, she's actually eating less and has more energy. Overall a good product for my ""pot licker."" ;)"
5,Best dark chocolate ever,This is the very best super dark chocolate I've ever tasted.<br />I snack on a square or two in the afternoon and because the quality is so good... you only need a taste!
4,Really Tasty!!,These little cakes are really good. I bought them for me and my friend to try and she loved them too.  The only bad thing about it is that I ended up eating half the box in one go and all the sugar gave me a stomach ach.  So be sure to eat them slowly :P
4,Beet Root Juice,I love the Biotta brand and although we have many<br />health stores in the area - the ones that sell<br />the beetroot juice is a distance away - so it<br />is far better for me to order online.  I only<br />wish that it came in a larger size.
5,Great Product,"Love the quinoa, good price on this bundle for the red variety.  Hope this continues to be offered since it's very versatile, cooks fast, and is so nutritious!"
5,Great,"The flavor is great. I'm using it to make iced tea, but I'm sure it's good hot also. Everyone who has tasted it really loves it."
5,Blue Cornmeal Pancakes Put a Smile on My Face,"My wife and I searched everywhere as we have accumulated quite a few recipies calling for blue cornmeal.  I was a bit skeptical ordering this online, but the package arrived promptly and the 4 packages all had an expiration date of over a year and half in the future.  We will be using these for lots of great blue cornmeal pancakes! Yumm!"
5,"not just another boring ""trail mix""","This mix has a lot going on, and it all works. Perfectly toasted/glazed almonds, chewy little bits of apple, balsamic for tang, and flax seeds to make it officially ""healthy"". Great for between meals...or even for ""the trail""!"
1,dog ran away,I gave one of these (chicken flavor) to my dog and he sniffed it and ran away. Will not purchase again. I am going to return it if possible since I only took one out and my dog disliked it.
2,"Not bad, but there is better out there","Bigelow Pumpkin Spice (Autumn tea)<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: 30-60mg according to box<br />Ingredients- Black Tea, natural pumpkin flavors with other natural flavors (soy lecithin), cinnamon, licorice root, clove, ginger, pumpkin flakes<br /><br />**Very important on the first steep you do not go over 4 minutes, it produces a very bitter cup<br /><br />-Smell:  In packet(2)/ Steeping (2) Has a scent somewhat reminiscent of pumpkin but falls rather  flat something else overwhelms the pumpkin I may be off but I think it's the clove (scent intensifies when over ice)<br />-Taste<br />+Unsweetened : Hot (1)/Cold (2) Flavor of tea is rather bland, I detect very little pumpkin flavor,<br />+Sweetened: Hot(3)/Cold (3)-Flavor and body of tea really improves with the sweetener. Taste is still a little bland, but there is something very slightly bitter to it (perhaps the licorice, I do not like licorice root).<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and  1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-2nd steep (3.5) - On the second steep the flavors and scents finally come through and produce a more respectable cup however still on the weaker side for me.  It should be noted the 2nd steep will stand up to a longer steeping time. Tried a 3rd steep and it was too weak.<br /><br />Summary- I paid more for this than on Amazon by ordering a holiday tea collection direct from Bigelow (the single box on here was to much and I wanted variety. I love Halloween and as such pumpkin things tend to suck me in, for the price it is on here I would not discourage purchase however just know there is better out there. If you are looking for something to get you in the mood for fall, this will do. I will happily finish the box, but unless it is clearance at a store I do not plan to purchase more.<br /><br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp) ""steep"" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference.  I use plain lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my other tea reviews this is only my 2nd so far."
5,Bo loves it!,"I love giving my dog Bo a variety of dog foods so that he does not get bored with the same taste day after day. Sometimes when I give him a new dog food to try he will turn up his nose and walk away. When I poured the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food into his bowl, he dug right in! Bo didn't stop eating until the bowl was empty. Bo's review for this dog food is 5 stars - he loves it!"
5,Unbelievably Good for Gluten Free,"The only difference between this brand and ""regular"" noodles is the cooking time. I made these terrified they would be awful, and delighted that my husband actually liked it more than regular pasta. (He doesn't have to be gluten free, so if he likes it, that's a good thing!)<br /><br />When you're cooking these, you'll notice the water gets really white, so be sure you rinse it off and they do tend to take a little longer to cook than traditional wheat pastas. When you think they are done, take a bite of them to make sure they're not too ""al dente"". Once they are cooked, they have the exact same color and texture you'd expect.<br /><br />The price here is pretty good, especially if you have to travel a distance to find them near you - if 12 is too many, split the case with a gluten free friend or two."
5,Fantastic Waffles!,"I always purchase Krusteaz products when they are available as you cannot get a better product.<br />Best waffles ever!  Great bargain, always can expect a good deal from Amazon."
5,Piccalilli relish,"I looked high and low for a relish close to what my Motherinlaw made. I found it! Bylers is wonderful, the flavor fantastic. I reveived it within a few days. I love it on hotdogs and hamburgers."
5,HEALTHY,RECEIVED ON TIME.----CURBS APETITE.-HAVE BEEN DRINKING IT FOR SOME TIME NOW. IT HELPS ME WITH MI DIET. I TRULY RECOMEND IT.-<br />NICE FLAVOR -- I TAKE IT AS ICED COLD TEA.
5,Now my favorite Decaf,"I drink decaf when I drink coffee at night and I've settled on this as the best I've tasted. Most of the others were OK and I don't expect a decaf coffee to taste was good as a regular coffee. But, for my taste buds this works.<br /><br />BTW, Tully's Kona is my top regular coffee."
5,Great for the snob in all of us,This Espresso bean is one of the best  tasting beans I have ever tried on line.<br />sharp strong unique full flavor with just enough acidity taste.<br />You can't help but enjoy.<br />I am on my second order and will continue buying it as long as it remains available<br />I can compare it to the black tiger that is on the top of my list for full flavor kick in the pants coffees.
5,Great for school lunches!,"This product is sold in vending machines where I work, at $1 per bag.  By buying in bulk from Amazon, you get the product for a fraction of that per-unit cost. Enjoy!"
5,"High quality, low cost product","My sister introduced me to coconut oil and although she was weary about me using it as face lotion I showed her that it helped me A LOT with my dry skin and did not cause acne. Normally I have really dry skin on my nose at forehead to the extent that it would start peeling off in the middle of the day... and no lotions would work! :( Coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my skin fairly normal in this regard -- especially with the dry, harsh winters of IL. Any coconut oil would do, but this one is low cost, high quality, has fast shipping. Basically, once this jar runs out, I'm ordering it again."
5,Fantastic!,"My corgi loves these greenies!  I like it how the greenies come in a zippable bag inside the cardboard box!  I have the choice of throwing out the bag and using the box or vice versa!<br /><br />I chose the free shipping method.  It took awhile to ship, but once shipped, it came in a timely manner."
5,Delicious!,I needed more iron in my diet and have been trying to watch my weight. These chips are wonderful.  They have all the healthy elements I need with the satisfying 'crunch' I crave.
3,"Good, but not amazing","This coffee is a bit bitter, and the flavoring is sort of... muddled. ""Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie"" seems like an extravagant name for a sort-of spicy flavor, even if it is a nice flavor. There's also a fair amount of fine dust, so if you don't have a very fine filter, you'll find it floating in your coffee. I enjoyed the coffee well enough, but would buy something else next time."
5,Absolutely the Best Hazelnut K-cup!,These K-cups don't compare to any other.  They are the most flavorful than any I've tried.  I love Dunkin Donuts coffee and this is equally as good and alot less expensive!
5,My Favorite Sauce,"I've been eating this wing sauce for years.  Found it in a massive container at a surplus store and have been using it in a variety of ways.  My favorite is mixing it with some ranch for a zesty dipping sauce.  I've used it to make buffalo chicken pizza, I've poured it on wings, I've made buffalo chicken dip with it.<br /><br />I feel that its got the perfect flavor.  I've tried many others, but none have the zesty, tangy spice that this one offers.  I'm a big sauce fan and this one is always stocked in the fridge."
4,"A healthy, well-digesting food that is just a little large for my dogs.","Once their ancient, crumbling teeth break it down, the dogs like this food. It digests well, no problems for them there. But I am afraid it's back to Little Bites for my elderly doggies."
3,Don't forget to rinse,You'll want to cut the larger sections and rinse the grit off them before putting them into soup. My first experience with using dried mushrooms. The shipping and handling is a bit much for the weight.
5,Best Granola Bar out there!,"My whole family is in love with these Nature's Path Organic Granola Bars.  I love chocolate and coconut together, and this bar combines them beautifully.  These are great for in the car, in lunches and they make a great before bedtime snack."
5,Delicious AND nutritious?,"Yep!  Wow, I was really impressed with these cookies.  I was afraid when I bought them they would taste extremely ""meh"".  But wow.  I look FORWARD to getting to eat one for lunch or breakfast.  I'm impressed w/ the truly delicious taste and w/ all the nutrition it packs.  15% of your daily iron, 4% of your calcium, 6 grams of protein, plus vitamins A & C.  I can't believe healthy tastes SO yummy, is made with whole grains, and ISN'T made with anything you can't pronounce.  Everything in here is natural!  I'm totally sold. This will become a staple in my household!"
5,Excellent!!,am sooo pleased about finally finding such a quality company to buy from..I ordered three things from Burger's and they pkged ti very well..and the product itself tasted excellent..TYTY for such a wonderful product Burger's U Rock!! :)
4,Wish i had looked........,"purchase this for a evening dinner guests,they rave about how good they are. Making it a hit with them but i was disappointed as pistachios is my favorite. It is not the company fault it was mine. The Pistachios was salted and i wanted Unsalted but did not looked carefully when i ordered.<br />i wished i could had eaten them as i am on a salt free diet.<br />This won`t stop me from coming back. Thank you........"
5,Essential for most salads,"I don't use it on salads with fruit or fruit in the dressing, but it really enhances all other lettuce-type salads. Have used it for many years. Am now going to try Spike too, but it seems best for soups and such."
5,Great for giving pills,This is a great idea for giving pills. It worked great.. at first. Now my cat has decided she won't eat these anymore so its back to the pill popper
5,Great Variety,"I like the variety in this pack-nice to not have to pick out individual jars and my baby likes them all! The only thing I would suggest is if you have a picky eater, maybe buy one jar at a time to test them out before you buy a huge box."
5,Delicious and best with French Baguette,Tasty canned chicken spread.Especially for eating with French Baguette.Saving time and money for cooking and restaurants. Will order again in future.
5,Another amazing product!,These are just as wonderful as the other Kit Kat brands from the UK. The hazelnut flavor is to die for! I highly recommend eating these while drinking coffee. The flavor is unbelievable.
3,"Palatable, but cheats on the wheat.","I'm loyal to De Cecco for regular semolina pasta. Unfortunately its whole wheat fusilli (this product is fusilli despite the wrong picture) is only better than OK.  The taste is fine, not bitter at all, but the texture is difficult to get right, and resists binding with sauce.  I suggest creamier sauces that bring their own cling.  Note also that De Cecco's ""whole wheat"" pastas are not made with 100% whole wheat, but ""enriched whole wheat"" flour -- an euphemism for highly processed wheat."
5,Perfect....,"If you like a cup of coffee available for you anytime, then these are perfect.  One envelope makes the perfect cup of coffee.  Easy to take anywhere. GREAT for traveling!"
5,"Does what it's supposed to do, and does it effectively.","I'm not an endurance cyclist/runner, but I was pointed to this by one. I was looking for a carbohydrate/electrolyte product more effective than Gatorade, mainly for lifting, and occasionally cardio-intensive sports.<br /><br />I don't have any grand insight to offer, but can vouch that it does what it's supposed to do. I'm able to work out longer (~2 hours on a consistent basis) without experiencing symptoms of dehydration now, than when I didn't take this and either drank only water, or water and Gatorade (feeling mild nausea + dizziness past ~1.5 hours).<br /><br />It should also be noted that there's drastically less sugar/sodium per gram of carbs in this than Gatorade. This might not be important to everybody, but another of the reasons I wanted an alternative to Gatorade is that sodium is a migraine trigger for me.<br /><br />Cool Citrus tastes like soap, Tropical Fruit tastes like shampoo. Both of these tastes are mild, and between them I prefer the Tropical Fruit."
5,great product,"Had been buying greenies at the pet store for the past 7 years, best price on sale was $32.99. These are a great value."
5,The best peach favor in the US.,"After trying so many so-called peach flavored tea, I still think Bigelow Peach tea is the best in the US. Why so? Because most peach tea sold in the US either taste like Hisbicus Flowers, or with a strong citrus presence which resembles orange or lemon flavor. My only complaint is that this tea is caffeine-free. To solve this problem, I often put this tea bag in the same cup of my favorite caffeine red/black/white tea, and it works very well.<br /><br />For those peach-tea lovers, I also strongly recommend the British brand, Fortnum and Mason: Peach Flavored Black Chinese Tea. It is the best caffine-peach tea I tasted on earth. Unfortuantely, you can purchase that only in their UK retail shops, or through their web site."
5,best mango flavor ever,"if you like gummy bears and are looking for mango flavored, then this is it.  My family loves these gummies.  the best anywhere... I did my homework, trust me.  I'm a candy freak!!!"
5,My picky puppy loves these,"My bichon poodle mix is very, very picky about treats.  He is the only dog I know that will walk away or spit out treats.  But these Filet Mignon Dog Chews he LOVES. I am ordering another bag!"
5,Excellent quality.  A new favorite.,"The  most amazing thing about hemp seeds is the energizing effect.  This is not at all like a stimulant, but a deep and gentle energy that feels very natural.  There is a caveat, however.  The hulls.  It is probably impossible to eliminate all hulls and caution is necessary to protect teeth.  I would never sprinkle seeds on anything because of the danger that a hull could cause.  Just not worth it, but taking small bites from a spoon works well.  These seeds are probably as clean as is possible.  I am a convert."
5,A Big Hit!,These jelly beans tasted like the real thing.  The kids had fun tasting the different and some disgusting flavors (like dirt flavor for example).  I ordered more boxes!
3,There's better...,"I was really excited to try this brand as I've heard good things about it. I appreciate that all of the ingredients are organic however the overall taste of the product (to me) isn't that great. The chocolate ""flavor"" itself reminds me of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup that you'd put on ice cream.<br /><br />The ""Endangered Species Otter, Smooth Milk Chocolate (48%)"" tastes more dark than this, and much more ""chocolaty""."
2,"Very dry, kinda crumbly :\","I was pretty disappointed with this. It's incredibly dry, to the point of being almost crumbly in your mouth. I also thought the flavor itself could have been better.  I've made jerky myself that tastes much better than this."
2,Do not use this sugar for layer cakes if you intend to decorate them,"Too soft: I just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake-like layer cake intended for decoration (Wilton Butter cake recipe). This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out. I'm sure this is good for meringues and such, but I would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies. You would never get them out of or off the pan."
5,Delicious!,I LOVE this product.  Cherry soda without all the sugars and chemicals present in standard commercial brands.  Wonderful flavor with a nice fizz.
1,Not ESE pods!,It is not obvious from the product description but these are NOT single serve ESE-type espresso pods.  They do not fit in our Krups espresso machine at all.
5,Best deal around,"I've been paying $6 for an 8 oz. bag so this is a great deal.The box was quite heavy and I received free shipping,I almost feel guilty! I add fresh basil and several italian cheeses to mine and serve on pita or wrapped in lettuce-yummy."
5,Great Tea,Helped when I had a cold and soar throat and could not make it to the doctor-- I would purchase again
4,Great product gets rid of tartar!,My vet recommended these chews to help with the tartar on my older dog's teeth and said she needed to come in in 3 months to see if she needed a teeth cleaning (over $100).I began feeding her one a day. After a month I looked and most all of the brown junk near her gums was gone. Little did I know that dogs do not have the enzyme to break down this stuff as humans do. Such a deal and my dog loves them. They are a little expensive but seem to do the job.
1,Flash: Goober hates truffles!,I guess my palate is not as sophisticated as I had thought. I'm a rather adventurous diner but this truffle oil really cashed me out. I tried it on scallops and pretty near had to trash them. I have no idea what amuses people about truffle oil. I gave mine away (ananomously).
5,Like the good old days.,"I well remember when I was a kid and my parents would bring home from the store old fashioned DARK brown sugar.  To me it tasted as good or better than any candy, and wasn't like the white sugar with syrup added that passes for brown sugar today.<br />This Billingtons Natural Dark Brown Molasses Sugar reminds me of the way brown sugar used to be.  It is richly flavored and delicious!<br />If you like genuine dark brown sugar, this is the product."
4,To me this is the best taste of Gefilter fish but one  bottle was broken.,I would say the gefilte fish is five stars quality but one bottle was broken. I left massage to amazon packing people but with on response to me. As I did not know it was broken so the fish source was dropping around on my carpet upon my kitchen. This packing was so out of my imagination. It was over sized box without a proper cushioning. So the cans and glass bottles in conjunction to empty space composed a perfect rattling. My lesson to learn here was that I shall never combine the glass bottle and can in one order.
5,Good flavored whole bean coffee.,"Good flavor and a good price too.  I like stronger coffees, and this is a nice bold cup without any bitterness."
5,"Great value, timely delivery!","We all know what the product tastes like, so no need to review that.  I was initially concerned these wouldn't be shipped in time, since a lot of the other reviews described cancelled orders, etc.  But I noticed that many of them seemed to be referring to buying them as part of a manager's special or something and figured I'd give this a try.  I received the Skittles in 2 days (Amazon Prime, 2-day shipping) with no problems.  They were packaged well and they are otherwise just as described.  So while I can't speak for the problems that others had, for me this was a flawless order.  5 stars.<br /><br />Edit: I ordered this a second time recently.  Just like the first time, which was several months prior, they arrived promptly and in excellent condition."
5,Amazing!,Excellent product!! great tasting!! super healthy!! my 5 year old loves it too!! Can't ask for anything more.  Bye bye pediasure and ensure!
4,"better than ""regular""!!!","I am lucky that I am *not* gluten intolerant but for health reasons I'm trying to limit my gluten intake. This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I've tried and like Snyder's non-GF pretzels in many of the different varieties like Butter Snaps, Pumpernickle, and regular Sticks and Twists.<br /><br />Of ALL the pretzels I've tied , these are the BEST.<br /><br />They are crispy and a little harder than the regular sticks; they are a little less salty than the regular kinds as well with just a bare hint of sweetness. They taste what I'd call very homemade in a way I can't exactly put my finger on, but definitely not a run of the mill taste.<br /><br />For comparison, I've tried the Glutino GF Pretzels which are also VERY good but at generally a much higher price per bag. They are pretty much on par with quality of flavor even though the tastes are very different. The Synder's brand is definitely something special.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
1,Warning! Stay away!!,"This litter has a ""maximum ammonia shield"" that is great for oder, but will poison your cat if it sticks to their paws and they ingest it. Check out the product reviews for the item that pops up first when searched on google: www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000633RG0<br />Review after review says the same. Save youself an expensive very bill."
5,Kitten prey! So adorable,"My teething 8 week old babies really like this thing, they even play tug of war with it. By far the cutest thing is when they drag it around by the ribbons, it's almost as big as they are. Shows up nicely in photos with my black and grey darlings. Also a good full-body work out for them, they can chew it but also get the back paws involved."
5,Excellent snack,As babies start to teeth they tend to want snacks like these that can be a bit more appettizing than a plastic teething ring.  They can even be a good source of vitamins for that picky vegetable eater.  Have ordered them several times in bulk.
2,Bhindi? I think not,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE okra.  I grew up eating okra dishes my mom made and I can't get enough.  I'm also lazy, so when I saw that I could get pre-made okra in a box, I had to try it.  There are a bunch of other MTR boxes I've tried and some (like the pongal) are actually pretty good.<br /><br />The Bhindi Masala was terrible.  First, there is almost no okra in the box at all.  There is an occasional bit of green floating around, but for the most part, the package is full of some dark brown sludge that looks like an oil spill.  Second, you can probably guess why the sludge looks like so oily...the package has a ridiculous amount of fat.  I thought that veggies were supposed to be healthy!<br /><br />Regardless, try some other MTR boxes.  Bhindi Masala is definitely one to skip.  Anyone out there want the remaining boxes from my 10-Pack?"
4,"Tasty in moderation, taste better than they look","The resealable package is very nice, unlike their elvish competition.<br /><br />Upon first opening the package, the Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey cookies didn't look that appealing compared to the photos on the package.  The cookies are soft, dark, and small, only about 2 inches across.  Because they are filled with chocolate, they can get crumbly and therefore might break apart during shipping.  Photo uploaded.  I think they could make the package smaller and contain these type of cookies better.<br /><br />They taste good but very rich, one or two at a time is enough for me.  Which is good because 2 of these cookies have 18% of your daily saturated fat allowance and 13g of sugar.  I would recommend these for an occasional chocolate cookie fix, but enjoy in moderation."
5,"Find ""hard to Find"" tea","Stash Premium Chai Spice Black Tea can be hard to find on the local shelves, but is never more than a few clicks away on Amazon! The price is great and delivery is always as promised. Enjoy your tea from Amazon."
1,Big disappointment.,I had hoped this would compare to Starbucks Pike's Roast; however we couldn't drink it and neither could several friends we gave it to.
5,Brilliant for the lazy gourmand / bachelor,"I originally picked up this product in a market on a whim, and it was my introduction to the world of dry rub.  It's still my favorite.  All you do is rub this stuff on raw chicken and cook it however you like (toaster oven works fine).  You're eating tasty food in 15 minutes and have very little in the way of dirty dishes... my credo in my bachelor days."
5,Good filters!,"What can ya say? It's Melitta of course it's good:} I still have the box I bought last year. Buying a case of filters may seem silly but you'd be surprised what these things are good for! They are AWESOME for filtering fryer oil, using for snack cones etc"
5,Wonderful Enhancement,"On a recent stay at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale, I took part in a single malt scotch tasting sponsored by their Food and Beverage Department.  The beverage director used glasses of this shape and size, and talked about how the shape of the glass can enhance the single malt experience.  I was initially skeptical, but as soon as the tasting began I was convinced, and started looking to purchase a few for myself as soon as I returned home.  I only rarely drink single malt scotch (too expensive) but I've found my enjoyment of those rare moments increased by 100% as a result of these glasses.  They are pricey, but a wonderful way to help you enjoy your favorite single malt scotch, and I recommend them highly. Plus Amazon's prices were the best I could find when I purchased them."
4,They taste just fine at least...,"I've only eaten a couple of these so far, so I can't vouch for effectiveness, but I can say that they don't have any odd taste to them - they taste good like regular lollypops."
5,You can't eat just one!,"Strawberry Whoppers are one of our very favorite candies.  Fortunately they are relatively inexpensive because once we open a box we eat them all.  Of course they would last a bit longer if we didn't have to share them with Max and Lady, our two miniature schnauzers, but they are very demanding."
5,YummY,We recently got one of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies to try ViA Influenster and Quaker. And my family loved them! They don't taste store bought at all. They tasted home made!! Very soft and moist!
5,"100% Agar. Good price, worked well as a food stablizer.",Not really much to say about the product other than it arrived similar to as pictured and works as described. I used it as a natural stabilizer for doughnut icing which was excellent. American Wholesale got it to me in 4 days. I purchased 2 oz. USA product.
5,Wondeful bold coffee!,I love the bold taste of this coffee. No aftertaste or bitterness. I love the frustration free packaging. And at $0.60 per cup it's a great value for a k-cup!
5,Just what I was looking for,"Jennifer's review was spot on, I love this French Vanilla cappuccino! This is exactly what I was looking for, yes it's not your Starbucks cappuccino, it's more like what you get at mini-marts or service stations. I'm not a hard coffee drinker and this is just what I was looking for, Thank You, Jennifer."
5,I love this sauce!,I was introduced to Woody's as a 'secret' ingredient for baked beans by  a dear friend who unfortunately passed away prematurely.  Mike Dale's baked beans live on however among his many friends and he swore this (along with liberal bacon ends and pieces and Van Camps baked beans) was the secret ingredient.  I have to agree and have never failed to make it in his memory every year.  Always a big hit!
1,So disappointed in canned pumpkin,"I read the last few reviews indicating no dented cans and hoped for the best.  My box arrived today and I too received badly damaged, dented and unusable cans.  I'm not terribly picky but most cans are dented at the rims/seams and all are badly smashed all over.  This was my last hope for canned pumpkin for my dog.  I do not believe the Amazon packaging is the problem. The cans were already dented prior to being shrink-wrapped.  I do not believe stores would put these cans on their shelves and I would never buys cans with this much damage. I have never been unhappy with an Amazon purchase, but this product was a waste of my time."
1,ewwww,"i know the new version is supposed to be better for me, but it isn't ANYTHING for me (or the company's profits)if i will not buy it, as i will not eat it.  i actually threw out the box with unused product in it."
5,Favorite Family Pancake Mix,Our family favorite pancake mix.  Used to be carried at our local upscale grocery store.  Not any more... so glad to find it!
5,Restaurant quality Tropical Tea at home,I was in a restaurant in Long Beach the other day and loved the Iced Tea.  I asked the food server what the brand was and he went back and wrote it down for me. I went looking for a reasonable way to buy some for home use and found this product at Amazon.  It's very easy to prepare and tastes fantastic.<br /><br />If you like un-sweetend but flavorful Iced Tea - this is delicious!
5,Excellent Tea,"I absolutely love this tea.  I was never much of a tea drinker but love licorice so I decided to try it.  It has a sharp, clean taste of licorice with just a bit of spice.  My mother who is a huge tea drinker does not care for licorice but agreed to try it after I raved about it.  She did not like it at all, so I would say that you do have to like licorice to enjoy this tea."
5,Awesome!!!,"I tried everything I could think of to disguise my cats' pills, and nothing worked... until now!  My kitties love the pill pockets so much that they try to steal each others' pills! The pills I am giving are too big for the cats to swallow whole, so I break them into quarters and wrap each piece in 1/2 a pill pocket (they are soft like playdough so it's easy to mold them around the pill pieces).  I start by giving the cat a little piece of a pill pocket (without a pill) to whet his appetite, and then he quickly gobbles up all 4 quarters of the pill one after the other after the other... and still looks for more!  I'm surprised the cats don't chew these and discover the pill inside, but for some reason they don't. These are amazing!"
3,"A good snack, but not a great one","I generally like Kashi stuff, and love banana bread- so I thought I would give this a try.  The Banana Chocolate Chip bars are not strongly favored of banana (its pretty subtle) nor are there many chocolate chips (which helps keep the calories to a reasonable 140 per bar, with only 3 grams of total fat).<br /><br />The package is correct in that they are ""soft and chewy"" but they are also a bit dry.  I had mine with coffee, which seemed to complement each other.  Without something to drink, you will find these a bit too dry I think.<br /><br />Ingredient Check:  the reason the banana flavor is so subtle is that the first ingredient listed is ""apple puree concentrate"".  The second is seven grain flour (which gives it the dryer texture and slightly nutty taste).  Then pumpkin.  Then ""evaporated cane juice invert syrup"" aka sugar.  Then vegetable glycerin.  Finally banana puree makes an appearance.  So first in name, but clearly not in the ingredients.<br /><br />On the plus side, 1/2 serving of fruit and of veggies per bar each doesn't hurt.  And the 4 grams of Fiber per bar is 17% of the total daily value, which is outstanding.<br /><br />On the negative side, these aren't organic (""all natural"" doesn't really mean anything), and do appear to have quite a few potential allergens.  Those sensitive to the following should take notice: wheat, milk, soy, egg, PEANUT and ALMOND and may contain other tree nuts (emphasis added- you wouldn't expect this from the general product description and nut allergies are not to be messed with).<br /><br />In summary, while I liked these as a snack with coffee (especially at the Amazon price) the banana flavor was pretty subtle, chocolate chips rather spare and the texture was a bit dry.  But the calorie, fat and fiber profiles were quite good for a snack.  As a healthy snack I liked them, but did not love them."
4,My cats have been happy with this for years.,"My cats have been eating and enjoying this stuff for years and it seems to have helped the one with urinary tract problems. I suspect that the cats who got sick, got sick for some other reason. It is a bit hard to find. Not all pet or grocery stores carry it."
5,A Good Combination of Flavors and Textures,"As the weather changes, I am on the lookout for this season's beverage.  Tried quite a few of the k-cup offerings, but wanted to try something different.<br /><br />Nescafe Memento Cappuccino is a very good cool weather choice.  The foamy top layer gives you the feel of a coffee shop beverage, without having to leave the comfort of your home.  Per their description, the premixed packets contain real coffee, milk and sugar, which is what, captured my attention in the first place.  Many of the coffee companies, in an attempt to help the consumer cut calories offer that horrible stevia stuff, which in my opinion leaves a horrible aftertaste and I avoid any products with that or sucralose as an ingredient.<br /><br />Not too sweet, not too bitter, a good combination of flavors and textures for that midafternoon break from the rest of the world."
5,Nice chocolate flavor,This tea has a nice chocolate flavor. I like to have a cup in the evening to satisfy my chocolate craving with no calories or caffeine. It's also a good cold weather alternative for hot cocoa if you are trying to watch your weight. I like that there is no mint flavor with the chocolate--not easy to find. The tea doesn't get bitter or too strong if it brews a little too long and the black tea doesn't overwhelm the chocolate flavor. This was a great value for Stash tea on Amazon!
5,A Good Snack,"While this bar is nothing to become addicted to, it's a nice, filling snack. The fruit filling isn't overdone. There's just enough of it to give the bar a nice, slightly sweet taste without getting oozy and gooey. The bar isn't overwhelmed by flavors, so it isn't sickly sweet like a lot of 100 calorie snacks are. I wouldn't substitute this for desert (for that, I use Fiber One brownies) but I'll enjoy having a bar with lunch or between lunch and dinner!"
5,Fitness Magizine Healthiest Oatmeal,This won the Award for the Healthiest Oatmeal! I can see why 12g of Protein and it taste great! No added sugar or salt and it is so creamy it is by far the best instant Oatmeal I have ever had! And it hold me over past lunch. Love it!!!
4,Fine Chamomile Tea,"****<br />Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the package, Tazo writes, ""a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as ""creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes.  Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""minty, hay like, rose"". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.<br /><br />The bulk packaging is a definitely plus, making Tazo Calm much more affordable.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.<br />****"
5,A great deal on great popcorn.,"This would probably seem like too much popcorn to buy, but it's a great gift. My friends and family loved it. It taste amazing! This is a great deal on this popcorn too. I will be buying this again."
4,"GF, instructions are ridiculous","It tastes pretty good, but it says to use a lot of water on the package ... 3 quarts seems very excessive for mac and cheese.  Works well with half of that."
5,"YUMMY ""diet"" food!","I just received my order of this and the regular PB2 today.  I've lost 53 pounds on my current weight loss and exercise program, but have been wandering off down the road to fat land again, with peanut butter and chocolate chips.  I had this for dinner tonight on a multigrain bread, with a banana sliced in.  Can't even imagine the calories I saved and I have no desire to dig into the regular peanut butter jar.<br /><br />The taste isn't quite like real peanut butter, more like roasted peanuts to me, with just a hint of chocolate flavor.  Doesn't matter whether it has the exact taste or not as long as the fat is gone and the taste is good.  This passes the test with flying colors.<br /><br />The texture is not quite like the creamy fat of real peanut butter either, but I'm not bothered by it at all.<br /><br />I will buy this again and hope that my review helps others to at least give it a try.  It might just be my new BFF for the next 40 lbs.<br /><br />Glad I heard about this and decided to take it for a test drive."
5,Love this stuff!,"This is on my subscription products and if you could sign-up for weekly deliveries I would...that's how good it is. Okay, maybe not weekly, but I usually can't wait between my monthly deliveries and order an extra delivery each month. It's just the right combination of Orange and Mango -- not too mango-y, not too orange-y! Refreshing! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
5,Great Product,"I love these.  I needed plain panko bread crumbs for a chicken recipe and these were all that they had.  They were great.  I make fat chicken strips, dip them in egg, then bread them with these and pan fry them.  I make a dipping sauce of mayo and honey for them.  My husband and stepson love them.  In fact, my stepson requested that I make them for his birthday dinner.<br />I have had a hard time finding them in my supermarket all the time, so I ordered a case from Amazon.  I even gave a couple of boxes to friends so they can see how great these are."
1,poorly wrapped almond butter,I got my almond butter in the mail and opened it.  too my surprize i found chunks of almond butter<br />all around inside the box.  the almond butter become unsealed and splattered all arround inside the box during shipping<br />the shippers never heard of wrapping the almond butter in bubble wrap.  in order for it to arrive to my house safely from<br />amazon.com.  the bottles where never comletely inclosed in bubble wrap.  i called amazon.com up and they dont want me to return the broken jars of almond butter  i can not eat them after this<br />amazon.com says they will refund  my gift cards<br />i am sure glad they take my word for it<br />amazon. is great they reallystand behind what they sell at amazon.com<br />i will continue to shop there
5,Delicious and cheap....,"It may be a small packet, but it packs a powerful punch. I usually add a little extra water to make it not so strong."
5,Top-quality food for your puppy...,"Blue-buffalo is just the best dog food ever. I can't tell you how it tastes of course, but if you read the ingredient list, you will see your dog is not being fed corn meal and/or other by-products that affect the health of your pet. It will keep your pet healthy and this kind of quality diet will help your pet live longer. It is much more expensive than Pedigree or any other supermarket available food, but it is worth it. You are paying for true quality meals not just corn and bones that are grinded in the seemingly great Pedigree. If you go to the Blue Buffalo website, you can take the TRUE BLUE test to compare your brand of food to Blue Buffalo and they will give you a $5 OFF coupon for your pet food purchase upon completion of the survey. One thing to note is that even though this particular bag of food is for small breed puppies, it will not be easily chewed on by extremely small breeds like Chihuahuas. My Chihuahua was supposed to eat solid food since he was 2 months old, but could only chew BlueBuffalo until he was 8 months. It is a little tough because it addresses EVERY puppy, not MINI puppies. So, if you have an extra small breed pet, find a decent brand like Royal Canin MINI Baby Dog Food 30 while it develops stronger teeth to chew on Blue Buffalo puppy food. Blue Buffalo is better than Royal Canin. However, you have to make sure your puppy is ABLE to chew on his kibble so that it does not get malnourished from eating to little. Once your puppy grows strong enough to chew on Blue Buffalo, switch him/her. It is simply the best."
2,cat's about face,"Unlike the Party Mix offerings, which my cats love and are a hard crunchy product, the Whisker Lickins line is soft and the flavorings are a bust as far as all my cats are concerned.  Friskie's missed on this one."
5,taste awesome!,these taste amazing. might make the poops burn a little :o but they taste amazing. the salt and vinegar ones are the best and very addicting.
4,Nice collection of dried fruit,"These are well done dried fruits and nothing wrong with them.  However, I didn't give it a 5-star because about the same time I ordered these, I simultaneously raided the bulk foods section of my local grocery store and put together a dried mix that I liked a lot better."
4,Diet Secret,"This is my diet secret> I needed soething salty and crunchy in my bag of tricks to help keep me on my diet, I love these things! Even if I eat a whole large bag it's still about 300 calories! I like all the flavors and I really like the samll snack size bags. I couldn't get them anywhere but on AMAZON!"
5,Great tomatoes.,"I love these tomatoes. I buy them buy the case at the store. I enjoy these in chili, & I also have them tossed in with cooked pasta, especially spaghetti. Also good in goulash. Highly recommended."
5,FancyFeast cat food,"The service is ALWAYS good! They are always prompt, as well. My cat loves the stuff and won't eat anything else.  A+++!!!"
4,"Good and healthy food, but an unwanted side effect","Dr. Harvey's Canine Health Miracle Dog Food pre-mix is handy if you feed your dog home-cooked meals. It contains a lot of veggies and nutrients, and only takes a few minutes to add to the protein (browned bison, for my dog) and oil (olive is what I use) for a complete meal.<br /><br />My dog likes the food and eats it all with relish. She's healthy eating it, too. I have only one complaint. The pre-mix, when hot water is added, turns a dark pink. I talked to someone at Dr. Harvey's customer service number, and was told it's probably beets that are making it that color since the food contains no dyes. The problem with the food taking on that dark pink color is that a dog with white hair eating the food will get dark pink stains on the hair around her mouth. When she eliminates, it also stains the white hair in that region dark pink! Sometimes she will chew on one of her paws soon after eating and--you guessed it! The white hair on that paw turns dark pink!  I've tried thoroughly washing her whiskers as soon as she's finished eating, but it doesn't remove the pink color. Washing in the other stained areas doesn't help either.<br /><br />If your dog has a dark coat, it probably won't show. Just be aware that a dog with a white coat is going to have some dark pink staining after eating this food.  I suggested to Dr. Harvey's customer service agent that removing the beets and replacing that veg with something else might be a good thing to do, but I don't guess they took me seriously! Maybe no one else complains...or cares about having a two-toned dog with dark pink stains on her coat."
3,"Good product, but packaging problem","My Wheaten puppy likes these treats and I like that they're made from good ingredients. But I gave this product three stars, because there was a problem with its packaging. The interlocking seal doesn't line up, so the bag is impossible to close. I guess I'll just repackage the treats myself. It's not a huge problem, but I'm just a little disappointed."
5,My baby loves these!,"I normally make my own baby food, but when we travel my stuff doesn't hold up very well so I give my baby this and she LOVES it. She hates jarred food and I normally can't get her to eat it. But she will eat this stuff. I have even tasted it myself and it is pretty good."
4,Hi-Chew,"This assortment pack of Hi-Chew is well worth the money. I enjoyed all the flavors, but my favorite is grape. Although I am surprised at the Saturated Fat content, (4.5g). Didn't expect something like this to have that much fat in it."
5,Gluten Free Biscuits,Our dog is allergic to wheat.  It is difficult to find gluten free products in the pet stores.  These are great and my dog loves them.
1,Dentastix-cheaper,"I haven't try these yet, but I priced them at Walmart. A pk for large dogs has 32 stix and is $12.00."
4,"""Tres intense"" K-cup blend stronger than the usual fare","Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops. My wife favors a latte or mocha, so she found Dark Magic too strong. I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast.<br /><br />I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI"">Fair Trade Gingerbread</a> I drank earlier in the week. Dark Magic is bolder than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y"">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS"">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a> but no more bitter.<br /><br />If you need more caffeine, I recommend you add a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TTG2"">SToK Caffeinated Black Coffee Shot</a>.<br /><br />In summary, I like ""tres intense"" roasts and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW"">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a> is the darkest I have found in the Keurig lineup. I will post an update should I try a stronger blend than Dark Magic. Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here are other coffees I recently reviewed for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2"">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y"">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW"">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS"">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI"">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>"
5,The best cereal ever.,"I've had almost every type of cereal out there, and this is the best.  Take a delicious, perfect, organic raisin bran and add crunchy, lightly sweetened oat clusters lightly flavored with Organic Cardamom Seed, Organic Fennel Seed, Organic Fenugreek Seed, Organic Nutmeg.. what do you have?  Mouth-watering perfection. As a bonus, it happens to be healthy."
4,JDH59,THERE IS RISK IN LIFE'S CHOICES. I CHOSE STEVIA  LIME FLAVORED DRINK MIX BECAUUSE I WANTED A DRINK MIX THAT QUENTCHED MY THIRST.  THE LIME FLAVOR WAS A GOOD CHOICE.  I FOUND I COULD USE A WHOLE FLAVOR PACKET IN A QUART OF COLD WATER AND HAVE TWICE AS MUCH AND STILL HAVE A REFRESHING LIME FLAVOR AND NO CALORIES.  I'M PLANNING ON PURCHASING ANOTHER FLAVOR SOON
1,TOTALLY MISLEADING,"Totally misleading; where do i begin.<br /><br />It is not GOJI BERRY like the heading implies; rather, it is goji flavor. Furthermore; it has lots of other ingredients although the title leads you to believe otherwise.<br /><br />It has raspberry leaf, hibiscus, strawberry FLAVOR, licorice powder... a very complex blend in my opinion; considering they lead you to believe it is: GOJI BERRY, MATCHA and GREEN TEA.<br /><br />Goji berries are full of nutrients and antioxidants. WHAT THE HECK IS ""GOJI FLAVOR"" and why does the heading on the front of the teabag state it is goji berry when it is not?<br /><br />WAY TOO SWEET in addition. A true mislead and disappointment. Shame on them.<br /><br />How can they have the audacity to call the teabag 100% Natural Ingredients? What is goji flavor and strawberry flavor? Tastes terrible."
5,The closest thing to FRESH GOAT milk,"My poor baby was lactose intolerant and suffered from colics, so I had to give her that soy stuff I won't even touch. When she turned 12-mon/old and thanks to a friend I found Meyenberq... My toddler loves it and after some research I can't believe I didn't try it sooner.  I have also tried fresh from the farm goat milk. OMG!!! is hard to get in NJ but totally worth it. I can order it online from a source and boil it at home. Can't get fresher than that. Still love Meyernberq and use it when I need it.  It worked out great for our vacation to the caribbean last week!<br /><br />If you research store bought caw milk you will be disgusted at what you are drinking, specially the UHT stuff. Try raw milk. You can get it in Connecticut and NYC. Don't be scared about the bad publicity, that is just another way to use ""fear"" to manipulate consumers. Be cautious and informed. Visit farms, boil it at home, wash your hands. That's all it takes and if you are really comfortable, drink it raw! so many benefits you wouldn't even believe. ENJOY!"
5,Yum!,These are really great. You never know what to expect with gluten free products. You can't even tell it's gluten free. Thank you!
5,By far My Favorite Litter,"I'm not a fan of the UltraLast variety, but Arm & Hammer litter works really well, especially this version.  We have one cat but buy this litter almost exclusively.  We don't empty the litter all that often, so smell control is very important.  Our cat seems to like it and most guests seem surprised to find out we own a pet, so I count that as an A+ performance."
5,Good deal,"This is the largest bag I've seen, much bigger than what you can buy at Wal-Mart; it will last a long time. Go with the periodic shipment approach to save 15%. That price ends up being a really good deal."
5,Wonderful company!,I didn't realize it but my tea wasn't arriving as promptly as suggested. The company also noticed and sent a box out immediately! WOW! I was very impressed!
5,Hands down one of the best foods on the market today,"I have two Basenjis both of who are under breed weight/size and who have corn allergies. I cannot stress enough how awesome this food has been for them. Their appetites are up, they are putting on weight, they have more energy where their other food (which was also on the Top Ten Dog Foods List) made them sluggish and caused one to lick a hole in herself. This food has given me my girls back and I recommend it highly to anyone who has issues with small breeds with allergies. I could go on and on about the differences but honestly, buy a bag and try it. There is nothing I can say that you won't see for yourself."
5,Super Gravy is bowl lickin' good!,"Dakota licks the bowl now that we are adding Super Gravy to her kibbles.  Super gravy is like a flavorful ""au jus"" style gravy for your pet. Try it with your pet if you want to see the bowl licked clean.  Plus we save money since we no longer have to purchase canned dog food."
5,pill pockets for cats,"While I swear by this product and have ordered it several times, I did not find it well packed this time.  Usually it's come in a box, but this time the 6 packs were just jammed into a padded envelope so the actual pockets were smashed....still usable, just not in great shape.  I think the supplier should go back to using a box."
5,Delicious!,I've ordered this salmon for 5 or 6 times and I will conitue to order it! Every time it goes to my Girlfriend in Vladivostok! It arrives in good time and the queality is just great!
2,Just OK,"I have always seen this item in the coffee section of my local market so I assumed it was coffee based. After trying it several times it certainly tasted to me like a malty hot chocolate drink. The ingredient lists ""instant coffee"" and no chocolate so it is coffee after all - I was fooled.<br />  I found the taste overly sweet. The item could of used more of the bitterness of the coffee to tone down the sweetness. Nonetheless the item was a pleasant drink on a cold day but nothing out of the ordinary."
3,Unimpressed,"I use treats for obedience and agility classes.  I need a treat that is not crunchy, but chewy and capable of breaking up into small bits.  This product is easily broken up...too easily.  It reminds me of a thin layer of chocolate but does not melt as such. The selling point is the natural dehydration, rather than freeze dried.  I did not find it useful for my purpose."
5,Great tea,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
4,"FINALLY, I FOUND IT","Looked and looked all over for this product in the form of cubes for several years now. Was always able to buy the cube form in the supermarkets until it was discontinued many years ago. I would add some of the fish bouillion cube when making fresh fish broth for fish soup, I would put a little bit of the cube when making white clam sauce and when making fish stews. The bouillion would add more flavor to whatever it was I was cooking. Making stew and clam sauce without the cubes, the flavor wasn't the same, definitely something missing. Because there was no fish cube bouillion to be had anywhere I stayed away from making any of these tasty dishes, knowing that the dishes  would not taste the same. One day I finally had enough, I wanted clam sauce, I decided I would look on Amazon and see if the product would be available there. Why would it, I looked on the Knorr website to see where I could purchase the product in my area, answer.....NO WHERE,  I've also gone to many international markets in and out of my area, and NOTHING. So I was not hopeful I would find it on Amazon. What I did find was the powder form in a large container. I didn't care how large the container,  I know it will last me forever so I will be giving some to family members. After receiving bouillion in the mail, I made white clam sauce with fresh littleneck clams and I couldn't have been happier to add a little of the fish bouillion powder mix to the clam sauce. The clam sauce is once again amazing in flavor, you know, that special little something! FAMILY AND I ARE HAPPY ONCE AGAIN!!!!"
5,"Safe, and EFFECTIVE","I recently gave up my major 20 year Diet Coke addiction.  I did it for a number of reasons.  I typically wake VERY early to hit the gym before work & needed something to help me wake up at 4:30 AM.  This product is GREAT.  No over-stimulation as it only has the caffeine equivalent of 1 cup of jo. It is also SUGAR FREE and has 0 Net Carbs!! I do feel the energy quickly & it lasts the 5 hours it claims.  The berry flavor is pleasant, but tart so I drink some water as a ""chaser"" (no pun intended).  I drink water the rest of the day & only use 1 in the morning unless I have a ""late"" meeting scheduled."
4,Order fulfillment/warehouse problems?,"The product I ordered was fine; the price, vis-a-vis supermarket, was excellent! Delivery time, great.<br /><br />BUT what I ordered was a 6-units-for-the-price grocery thing. What I got was a single unit, NOT the 6.<br /><br />When I called about this, the mistake was corrected immediately, so that was good. And I got to keep the single unit I received FREE. That was nice.<br /><br />Still, you may have a picking-and-packing problem in the dog-treat division. Any ideas on how to avoid this? The order form doesn't supply any alert mechanism. SO I GUESS THE PICKER JUST HAS TO READ THE ORDER MORE CAREFULLY?"
4,Very good salt for a very good price,"I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />Flavor is clean with slight minerality. The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.<br /><br />Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus."
5,Healty choice and kids love 'em!,"I used to make a trip to Whole Foods every few months to stock up on these, but it was much easier and cheaper with Amazon.  My 4 year old loves these bunnies and my husband takes a box to work!  This is the tastiest fiber filled cracker and HELLO they are disguised as cute bunnies!"
4,Pretty good if you like the flavor.,"Vitamin Squeeze was very easy to use.  It gives you Vitamin C with no calories.  The mixture uses sucralose as the sweetener.  As with most artificial sweeteners, it may or may not trigger your bitter taste buds.  For me, it was also hard to get the right amount of sweetness:  It was either too light or too sweet.  If you can get the flavor right, then this is the energy drink for you."
5,Choolate Jacalat Larabars Rule,"These bars are decadent and good for you.  My husband and I are trying to eat ""closer to the earth,"" so we really like the fact that there are very few ingredients and NO added sugar.  Sure, they are expensive, but certainly bakery cookies and specialty cupcakes would cost a lot more.  This (along with almonds) is my snacking/dessert go-to item, and it's certainly cheaper than that syrup-laden latte I used to purchase daily."
5,Gloria Jeans Hazlenut kcups,"I love hazlenut coffee; and, these are the best!  I especially like it when I use the hazlenut creamers in it."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE these cookies!!!!,"My family have a lot of food allergies and Nana's cookies are always a good snack... (except for the ginger... I am not a ginger fan.)  These are by far the best.  It taste like a brownie... very yummy.  Even my friends and family that don't have allegies love it.  I have no idea why someone gave it such a poor review... guess they are able to eat a snickers bar.  And calorie wise, it's not that bad... heck of a lot better then other cookies.  I would totally recomend these.  My 2 month old loves them and so do I and my husband.  5 stars!!!"
5,I found the best price on these!,"Purchase them directly from the manufacturer and look for an online coupon.<br />Btw, I Love these. . . .  maybe its because I lived in Japan for 3 years .. . the ones at the grocery are made from soy/tofu (not good for me) so they are not an option.<br /><br />The customer service from this company is sterling.  And the price is great for the 30 pack bought directly from them esp. with the online coupon."
5,Mussini Balsamic Glaze,"Delicious drizzled with olive oil on veggies & salads. Nice syrupy flow. Ingredients listed are: cooked grape must, 39% Balsamic vinegar of Modena (wine vinegar, cooked grape must), sugar, modified starch. Like that there are few ingredients, with grape must and Balsamic vinegar of Modeda (39%-would higher be better?) being the top 2."
5,best dog toy we've found,"Bought one of these 3 years ago for our 2 dogs, one a Labrador and the other a 40 lb mutt.  It was intact until a few months ago when they finally tore it and killed the last squeaker.  Out of the hundreds of toys we have bought them we have found nothing that remotely compares to the durability of it, except for the hard  solid rubber toys and the dogs don't seem as interested in those. We've look in a variety of stores for a replacement and have had no luck.  I'm buying 2."
5,Perfect for a pinata,"Bought these to help fill a pinata, all the kids went crazy for them.  Each was individually wrapped well and candy was fresh. I would definitely purchase them again."
1,My cat rejects it... :(,"...I am at my wits end... My cat only eats one single brand of food - Purina One, and only chunks with gravy. I have tried soooo many healthy, grain free, organic foods, and he just won't eat them. It is ridiculous..!! TikiCat and other brands contain such amazing ingredients...how can he not like those???<br />The last time I wanted to force him to eat the good stuff and didn't give him Purina for several days...he pooped on my bath rug..!! Should I just give up and keep buying the cheap stuff..?? Any advice from my dear fellow cat griends..?? I'd be very thankful..."
3,"OK, but not great","I live near Seattle and have drunk ""Pike's Place Roast"" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right."
5,LOVE THIS CEREAL!,i grew up on this and still love as  an adult. i have to restrain myself from eating the whole box in a day. i am going to order in bulk from amazon for cost savings. buying cereal from the supermarket is pricey.
5,The best cup of coffee that I've brewed at home.,"I typically prefer espresso when I drink coffee beverages. However, when my in-laws bought me the Keurig I decided to start drinking regular coffee. I enjoy Breakfast Blend because it is a rich, smooth coffee without being too acidic. I can make iced coffee out of it and it doesn't get too watered down or lose it's flavor (assuming I wait about 15 minutes after brewing for the coffee to cool before pouring it over ice)."
5,Very delicious,"The dried cherries are very delicious. They have a great balance of tartness and sweetness. They have just the right level of moisture. Great for snacking or adding to recipes. Also fairly healthy, a great alternative to fruit snacks."
1,"Tastes like plastic, waste of money","These cups are not worth the minor convenience they provide.  The hot chocolate tastes like plastic... I can only assume it's a result of hot water hitting the plastic of the cup.  (Maybe the coffee ones don't give off this foul taste because of the filter inside?  I don't know.)  I can't even finish using the cups in the intended way; rather, I have taken to peeling off the foil, dumping the mix into my mug, and running a cycle of just water through the Keurig.  Nearly as simple, without the nasty taste.  I won't be buying these again.  I'll stick to using the normal packets and running aforementioned cycle of just water.<br /><br />Don't waste your money."
4,Loveley & Soothing,"This tea is very good.  The flavor is great and it's quite calming and soothing, especially in a nice bubble bath after a rough day!"
5,Best source of omega 3 and 6,"Besides being the best source of omega 3 and omega 6, it just tastes so good. I'm a vegetarian and had tried flax seed oil, but that tasted so bad i had to stop. So i do eat eggs from time to time so i get some omegas from that source. But when i started looking on the net for another source of omegas i read an article by Dr Andrew Weil [...] that told of hemp oil having the perfect balance of omegas (1 to 3 of omega 3 to omega 6). So i decided to try it. Now i use it on toast instead of anything else. And some on my daily salad. It has a great light nutty flavor. And i just heard that omegas are a blood thinner in case you need that in your life. To sum up, if you are a vegetarian or vegan and want a great source of omegas, get some hemp seed oil. Nutiva brand in the 24oz at amazon seems to be the best price i have found around and i have been eating this for a few years now, and its organic to boot. Grown and processed in Canada which, unlike the silly US, allows hemp to be grown for food, paper and other products. Enjoy and be healthy!"
5,THE BEST POP ROCKS EVER,"POP ROCKS 36 packs Strawberry Sold by candymachines/<br />Penguinmints Thru Amazon, & Free Super Saving Shipping...<br />  They are so fresh & they Definitely pop great<br />in your mouth, & they taste great also.. YUM, YUM..<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00155UY3W"">Pop Rocks 36 Packs Strawberry</a>"
5,Amazing coffee,This is my favorite coffee. I use it in my bialetti and it makes great espresso. Full and rich flavor. Somewhat hard to find in stores so u always buy on amazon.
1,"Penut Butter was very dry, couldn't even finish one!","These eggs are my favorite & I thought ordering them close to Easter (just a week or so after) they would still be nice & soft. The chocolate is a bit waxy on these anyway, but the peanut butter in these were so dry it was crumbling all over the place when I took a bite. I tried opening another one & it was exactly the same. Disappointing that these can't be returned but understandable."
5,Three ingredients - these are amazing!,I love Lara Bars - all of them.  It's amazing that they have so few ingredients but taste so good.  I even like the chocolate Lara Bars better than a real chocolate bar ... plus you get good nutrition from these bars and don't have to worry about strange ingredients or additives.  My husband and I buy these 4 cases at a time ...
4,GoPicnic meals come in handy...,"I like the concept of the GoPicnic ready-to-eat meals. They're a more healthy alternative compared to some ready-to-eat meals I see in the grocery store; another plus is they don't need refrigeration. I've purchased their SunnyBreak & ExploreMunch: Turkey Stick & Cheese 6-Pack for long car trips. We never eat them as a whole meal but pass around the box & pick what we want to snack on.<br /><br />GoPicnic meals are put together with a lot of thought, quality ingredients & quality products.  The salmon & crackers balanced meal contains 410 calories and 11 gr. of fiber, 22gr of protein; sodium content is 660mg or 28% of your daily requirement.<br /><br />Flavor & other info:<br />Chili Lime Salmon Spread: The taste of the salmon is not overpowered by the mild, spicy chili/lime spread. So, if you don't like the taste of fish, you won't want to purchase this. Getting back to the spicy flavor: it's not very spicy at all, which I prefer. If your taste buds prefer the 'crazy hot' spicy food that's so popular today, this will probably seem bland to you. Some of the ingredients in this spread: pink Alaskan salmon, red pepper paste, sugar, lime juice, vinegar, garlic powder & spices.<br /><br />Dry Roasted Edamame: These lightly salted, dry roasted green soybeans are crunchy with good flavor. Containing 130 calories, 8gr fiber, 14gr protein & 150mg/6% sodium it's a healthy addition to this meal.<br /><br />Late July Organic Classic Rich Crackers: These are very good, with a light, buttery taste. At 90 calories, 210mg/9% sodium they're on par with the average cracker...but these are organic and prepared with healthier ingredients & taste better than many other crackers.<br /><br />Ginger Zip: Contains ginger peanuts, cranberries & banana chips; similar to a trail mix, it's good, fresh & crispy.<br /><br />Terra Nostra Organic Robust Dark 60% Cacao: This dark chocolate doesn't taste as bitter to me as others. I'm not a fan of dark chocolate, but it's good for you...and this tastes better than some & it's organic.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great meal to take with you on a long car trip, an outdoor outing or even something quick to pack for your lunch.  It also has a fork and a Sudoku puzzle...so don't forget to bring a drink with you and a pencil with an eraser for the puzzle."
3,ew,These smell really good but after cooking with them i am not impressed.  The chicken one is disgusting.  I like the glass bottles and the price.. this has a good selection but a couple weird ones you wont use often.  Not my fav.  Ill reuse the glass bottles to make my own rubs.
5,Awesome veggie snacki,"I absolutely love this stuff -- the mesquite lime flavor is sweet, spicy and tangy, and the consistency of the jerky is chewy yet moist. At 74 calories and 10 grams of cholesterol-free meatless protein, you can't beat it as a snack."
4,Can't Believe This Is Sugar Free!,"While this Cider is sugar free, I wouldn't know it unless I saw the packaging.  It's still a little too sweet for my liking, but that's just me (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  I brew it with 10 oz of water instead of 8 to help with the sweetness.  And for the price, you can't hardly beat it!"
5,Great food for cats or kittens with sensitive stomachs or food allergies,"My 9 month old kitten has had trouble with diarrhea since we got him and it doesn't seem to have a medical cause, he either has a food allergy or just a sensitive stomach. We gradually switched him to this food about 3 weeks ago and have had good success with it. The diarrhea has stopped and he really seems to like this food. I did a slow switch, adding small amounts to the dry food he had been eating and eventually feeding him 100% Natural Balance. We're very happy with how well this food has worked for our cat and plan to keep him on it. The nutrition content is excellent and for a premium food, the price is quite reasonable. I'd rather pay for a quality food like this and have a healthy cat than buy a poor quality cheap food and end up spending more in vet bills. My kitten's coat is very shiny and soft, his weight is perfect and even my other cat, a very picky eater, likes this food. I like the limited ingredients in this formula which is great for cats that might have allergies or be sensitive to the ingredients in other foods. Overall, I'm thrilled I found this food and my kitty is too!"
2,not happy,"When i read that these were ""long lasting"" i was hoping for a chew that would take my take more than 2 minutes for my 9 month old chocolate lab and 9 year old lab to chew. Not happy with this nylabone purchase!"
5,Wonderful Surprise,"I first bought this product at my local supermarket, but they hardly ever had them in stock so I came on here looking for them.  Not only are they delicious, but they did something I didn't expect.  I had heard that walnuts are good for cholesterol, but I was shocked at how good they are.  I've struggled with my LDL for years and I don't want to take medicine.  I did nothing at all to change my diet and exercise routine except to add a handful of these walnuts every day - and my cholesterol was better than ever.  My LDL went down.  This is no coincidence as I have my numbers checked every 3 months without fail and this was the best set of test results that I've ever had.  It's nice that something that tastes so great is also good for you!"
4,Very Good popcorn,"My only gripe is it did not come vacuum sealed or with a safety seal.<br />Not that I think any one can mess with popcorn, BUT, the lid is large, so I put the jar on its side (I tilted it while opening) and popcorn came spilling out all over the floor.<br />Almost every kernel pops. Overall, a very good product, but only as exciting as, well, popcorn can get."
5,thank you amazon,My husband is on a very restricted sodium diet and I have a lot of trouble finding salad dressing and marinades or making them and this fits perfectly into his diet and tastes terrific.  I use it to marinade chicken or meat and he puts it directly on his salads.<br />It is wonderful to find something that tastes so good and is so low in sodium.  That is not easy to do.<br />I will continue to order this even if he didn't have the restrictions.
3,No nitrites?  Look again.,"I try to stay away from buying any meats that contain nitrites and I specifically read carefully through the description of the Wild Ride jerky, and here's a direct quote: ""Wild Ride is made with all-natural ingredients with no preservatives, no MSG, and no nitrites.""<br /><br />We haven't tasted it yet, so I can't attest to that, but I was very disappointed to read in the ingredients list that it contains: ""Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite).""<br /><br />No worries if your not concerned about nitrites, but if you are, just know this product DOES contain nitrites."
5,Very good taste,"These strawberry licorice wheels taste great but should not be confused with the original strawberry wheels I enjoyed so much in my youth. The taste and texture are completely different.<br /><br />The ones I remember from the 60's & 70's were made of a flat ribbonlike licorice rolled into a wheel; some even had a small jaw breaker type candy in the center.<br /><br />These are made of a somewhat oily 2 strand round shoestring licorice rolled into a wheel.<br /><br />Again, product tastes GREAT but......"
3,Cans too dented to open,"Many of the cans were too DENTED to open in our electric can opener.  These cans appear to be returns to the distributor from retail stores because they are too heavily damaged to be marketed.<br /><br />My best guess is this distributor is taking ten cans of product he would normally have to throw away, packing a couple normal cans with it and selling it on Amazon.<br /><br />EVEN the CENTER CANS in the carton were badly dented.  But the cans were excellently pack with air cushion bags all around.  Accordingly, they were NOT damaged during shipment to me.<br /><br />The rounds, which are actually more meat bally spherical than round, taste acceptable.  I didn't check the expiration date.<br /><br />Three stars because I like acceptable tasting meat substitues.<br /><br />It would be nice if Amazon inspected the distributor since this product is not being sold ""damaged"" but I see I'm not the only one reporting this problem."
5,Good Tea,I am just now getting into teas. I have had herbal teas in the past and they all tasted the same (to me) like drinking grass. Yuck! I recently bought this tea and can honestly say that I like it and will buy more. I personally add a little milk and some Stevia sweetener.  I also like the Jasmine tea they make.
5,Pumpkin Spice is back!!!,"Several years ago in a Target grocery aisle far, far away I found Maxwell House International Cafe Pumpkin Spice latte. (Formerly General Foods International Coffees. Remember the ""Jean Luc"" commercial? Yes, that stuff.) It was a limited edition flavor... it was on clearance... I bought all the tins that remained... even the one with the huge dent. This stuff was that good. Then it was gone and all I had left was a single empty tin to remind me that this flavor wasn't something I only imagined or conjured up in a dream. Now it is finally back! It has a different formula that becomes distinctly frothier but it tastes just as mmm, mmm good as I remember."
5,The best cocoa for making brownies,"If you are making brownies, this cocoa is far superior to any other brand.  Also great for making hot chocolate."
5,If You LOVE Velveeta Cheese...,"I was raised up in a family with no other cheese than Velveeta! I'm 63 years 'young' now...and have been enjoying this for years.<br />When I found it in here, and free shipping!...I immediately bought it, and have been a repeat customer.<br />If you love Velveeta Cheese, then this is something you're going to love! It's so much better than the powdered mixes that you need to add butter and milk to.<br />This has the thick, creamy mixture right in a sealed foil pouch. You cook the sheels, drain, and then stir in the pouch of cheese.<br />Nothing could be simpler! I actually don't drain off all the water, because the cheese sauce is so nice and thick ;-)<br />I'm on here today to buy another 12 boxes. A wonderful product for those of you that love Velveeta cheese!"
5,warning: addictive,"if you're a chocolate lover, and I am, you have to try this, it is sooooooooo good, warning though, you won't be able to stop with just one bite, before you've realize it you've consumed the whole bar."
4,love it,"This is the best canned coconut water i've found that wasn't sweeteend or full of preservatives.  Amazon has a decent price, especially with free shipping. I've recently discovered that my local ""fresh&easy"" market is selling them for 1.99/can, so even less than amazon if you happen to have one near you, you can save $.25/can and the wait for shipping."
5,Great plants and service,"All plants arrived in good shape and in just a few days after ordering.  I did receive a variety of plants in type, color, shape and size.  The included care information is very helpful and easy to understand.  I will order from this seller again!"
3,Tiny packs,"Mini is really the appropriate word.  You pay more for the packaging...better off to buy the bigger bags. What is in each packet is about the equivalent of two regular size gummi bears.  They taste great, but would recommend the larger bags unless you just want ""cute""."
5,Love this product!,My dog simply loves this mini naturals! I use them mainly to train with and it is super easy because my dog wants them so bad he'll do whatever I tell him!
5,I prefer the flavored,"Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.  I realize that taste is a personal thing.  That's why they make chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla.<br /><br />Here's my current favorites""<br /><br /> 1st Blue Diamond Dark mint dark chocolate (reminds me of the chocolate mint Girl Scout Cookies with less sugar).<br /><br />2nd Blue diamond Dark Chocolate Oven Roasted<br />3rd  Blue diamond Blue Butter Toffee<br />4thd Blue Diamond Almonds Bold Habanero BBQ (reminds me of  BBQ potato chips again with less sugar).<br />5th Bold Blazin Buffalo Wing<br />6th Blue Diamond Almonds Cinnamon Brown Sugar<br />7th  Blue Diamond Almonds Lime `n Chili<br />8th  Blue Diamond Almonds Smokehouse<br />9th  Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce<br /><br />But that's just me: you might have a completely different take on these flavors.<br /> 4th  and 5th are very close.<br /><br />Gunner<br />May, 2012"
5,Delicious!,"My favorite of the Smart Fries flavors.  Vinegar taste, without eating away at your teeth, mouth and gums!  I have sensitive teeth, and love S&V chips, but can't handle too many at once due to the acid.  These are a great alternative."
5,world's best kraut,"Silver Floss is definitely the world's BEST sauerkraut! I first tasted it at a little hot dog stand in LaGrange Georgia (they have the world's best hot dogs there). I liked the kraut so much I broke down and ordered a case of it in June, and I've already eaten half of it. I've eaten it with hot dogs, brats,and ribs, but I've eaten a lot of it by itself. It's great cold, but heating it makes it even better."
5,Jamica Me Crazy.....So Good!,"I was surprised to find out the coffee from my sampler had coconut in it.  I bought a sampler of k-cups to try different flavors and would sit aside the ones that I liked to order in the future.<br /><br />After drinking Jamaica Me Crazy not realizing the ingredients just knowing I liked it.  When ordering, reading through the reviews realized it had coconut in it and that was what made the taste so yummy, leaving me wanting more.  I was hesitant to buy but decided to go for it and am really glad I did.  Everyone I have shared my coffee surprise with loves it too."
1,NASTY!!!!!,"This is horrible tasting coffee! I have been pleased with all the flavors I have tried so far, but this is not one of them!!!"
5,Have always loved these...,"Have always loved these...Snackwell's Devil's Food Cookies, 6.75-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)  But now on Weight Watchers these are ONLY one point each....so Now they are my favorite!"
5,Great service!,I love this lemon ginger tea. It has a rich flavor. I have found no other brand that compares!
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato, and they assured me that they'd checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center.  However, the ones I received did not and I feel like I was lied to by customer service because they didn't want to take the time to actually check into it."
5,Hearty!,"I found this when looking to upgrade my oatmeal. As expected this is MUCH heartier than regular oats. I used the microwave to nuke a small portion of this and the grains retain a lot of texture; they don't melt into mush like oatmeal does. (But not TOO much texture. You won't be eating a bowl of grains/seeds). The flavor was very mild and I found adding a bit of dried cranberries, brown sugar, and splash of vanilla coconut milk made for a subtly sweet and filling breakfast! I enjoyed this mix much better than plain oatmeal. It's not as bland and boring. It's hearty and healthy without actually tasting like health food!"
5,Espresso roast,"Nothing really that I can add that has not been previously written.  I use it each morning for a cup of expresso.  Smooth, rich, delicious.  A bit pricey and yet well worth it.  It compares well with German espressos I grew to love while living there."
2,Unpleasant,"I wish I could say that this was good, however I found it very unpleasant and not very spicy (and I'm a liteweight).  It has an aftertaste to it that I could not get past and would not recommend this product."
5,Yum! times 10,"These are stunningly delicious.  If you heat them for a few seconds in the microwave (or take them along on a hot summer day's picnic), they're soft and chewy and addictive."
4,A great dark coffee,There are few Keurig coffees out there that are strong enough for me. This one clearly is with wonderful taste and smell. Amongst my favorites if you like black coffee.
5,oatmeal cookies,What happened to the oatmeal cookies. You've been out of stock for months. Are you getting them in? They are the best !
5,BEST SALAD DRESSING /MARINADE,KRAFTS SEVEN SEAS VIVA ITALIAN... IS THE BEST SALAD DRESSING AND MARINADE.... I'VE USED IT FOR 20 SOME YEARS... I'VE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING IT IN LOCAL STORES...I ORDERED TWO CASES...
5,"Excellent, authentic Japanese-style tea","This is a lovely, unsweetened, Japanese-style true green tea.  It is NOT your typical American tea with added corn syrup or sickeningly sweet artificial sweeteners, so if you are looking for a sweet tea you should skip it.  But it is a delicious, smooth, non-bitter green tea... and that is *very* hard to find outside of East Asia.<br /><br />My work takes me to Japan with some frequency, where I became a fan of conveniently bottled cool green teas.  This is the only tea I have found readily available in the U.S. that matches the quality and taste I expect in Japan. (Ito En is, after all, a Japanese company.)<br /><br />If you can't stand the oversweetened stuff that passes for bottled tea in North America and enjoy the taste of straight green tea, this product is probably a good fit for you."
5,"Awesome, Beautifully Balanced Coffee","This is the absolute finest coffee that Tassimo has to offer!  If I had known that the relationship between Tassimo and Starbucks was coming to an end, I would not have purchased their coffee maker.  This coffee offers an intricate depth of dark roasted coffee with none of the bitterness."
5,great product,"this cake is delicious, i used it to make my daughter's birthday cake and everyone wanted seconds, they liked it better than the regular, glutenous cake."
4,Tasty,"The Cinnamon Roll flavors are not quite as good as the other Larabars.  There is just not enough cinnamon for my tastes.  However, they are still very tasty!"
5,"Innovative, healthy and YUMMY!","We love these HappyTots! The flavors are wonderful and the added Salba grain is a great way to add nutrients. My son is in Kindergarten and he asks to take these to school for snack time. The pear added to this combo is especially nice since it adds sweetness not found in the veggies - a very nice balance of flavor. Also, the convenience of the pouch is so great, I keep some in my bag, in my car and at the grandparent's house so I know a healthy snack is always available. Highly recommend trying this product and flavor if you are looking to add tasty nutrition to your child's diet."
5,Cappuccino for Keurig,"This is the best Cappuccino that you can get for your Keurig!!!  We love it!!  If you like the taste of a cappuccino out but can never get that taste at home, this will solve your problem.  I think you will be very pleased with this purchase."
5,Great coffee at great value,If you have a Senseo machine and drink a lot of coffee...this is a great value and will stock you up for a while. Dark yet smooth roast.
3,"Taste great, but beware the high fat levels","They are delicious, yes, but I'm confused how a relatively small bar packing this much fat can be called ""healthy.""  And they sure don't tell you about it in their description!"
5,Ragu Pasta Sauce,My favorite one. I am very happy with this spaghetti sauce. I am very happy with this purchase. It all arrived safely.
3,"OK, but kinda bland","I like the texture of this cereal, and I'm a big fan of peanuts, but this just seems a little bland to me.  It's not a bad taste, just not really very strong to me, so it's kinda like eating semi-sweet slightly flavored little crunchy pieces of cardboard or something.  If it had a stronger flavor or maybe another flavor in addition to what it has I think I would enjoy it more."
5,Perfect,Not much else to say than that the product was perfect just like buying it at the store. Shipping was fast too! I am very please and will definately return as a customer at a later time.
4,Wow!,This item was featured on Dr Oz show as he was spotlighting healthier snack alternatives.  The chocolate chunk are the only ones available on amazon right now so that's the one I tried.  They are crazy good!  My mistake was giving some out at work and now I have to order more.<br /><br />The reviews for all the products are being lumped together in the ratings.  The Honey Graham Sticks doesn't taste like graham at all.  It's more like an animal cracker with a little more flavor.  The vanilla wafers are very good and taste much like Nilla wafers.  The madagascar vanilla have a buttery taste and are very crisp.  I've liked all but the graham sticks so far.
5,Multiple steepings of delicious tea & Gluten-free,"I love this tea!  I don't feel it is more expensive than other white teas because I get so many steepings from it that taste great.  Most other teas, I am lucky if I get 3 or 4 steepings with the 4th being weak.  I can re-steep these needles all day long and each steeping tastes as good as the first for me.  I use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5X826"">Medelco 12-Cup Glass Stovetop Whistling Kettle</a> and often throw out the first steeping if I don't feel like caffeine that day as most caffeine goes into the first steeping whereas all the healthy benefits are evenly distributed throughout many steepings.  After heating the purified water to 185¬∞F in my Medelco 12-Cup Glass Stovetop Whistling Kettle, I pour a little hot water into my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N2XMTG"">Primula Personal Glass Tea Mug</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4KMM8"">Teas Etc 12-Ounce Glass Brew Mug with Glass Brew Basket and Lid</a>, then add 1 1/2 tablespoons of Rishi Tea Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea, add 185¬∞F water, and steep for 4-5 minutes.  If I want caffeine that day, I enjoy the first steep right away!  If I don't want caffeine that day or it is already evening or for whatever reason, I throw out the first steep and start my second steep right away for me to enjoy my first cup soon!  Also, sometimes instead of throwing out the first steep, I will save for cooking vegetables or other cooking as this tea adds delicious flavors and healthy benefits.  This is one of my favorite teas!<br /><br />All of Rishi's teas are gluten free and are processed in Milwaukee in a gluten free facility."
2,No Cats Meow....,"This taste of the wild mountain feline formula is available at the local Tractor Supply company here.  I usually get my cat food and bird seed there, and decided on my last trip to give my kitty a treat with something special.  It's expensive as wet cat food goes, but I figured how could I go wrong with something with a name like this and a lion on the can.  I picked up three of them.  Unfortunately, my cat was not impressed by the price, or the label, for she sure didn't care for it to say the least.  I was really surprised actually, for unless we're talking about the very cheapest store brand of wet food, she usually isn't all that finicky a cat.  But this stuff didn't cut it with her at all.  Even after giving it to her again a couple of days later, and then leaving it out.  I ended up giving it to my neighbor who has three cats.  They ate it, but according to my neighbor they didn't act like it was exactly fine cuisine either. They ended up eating about half of it over a couple of days. I realize that a test with only 4 cats isn't all that comprehensive, but the consensus was the same nonetheless.  None of them liked it.  I suggest if you favor the idea of this stuff that you either try your local Tractor Supply and buy just one can, or better yet, forget it.  For the price you pay and test results around here, in my opinion it's nothing more than overpriced substandard fare in a flashy can..."
4,Good stuff!,"This hot cocoa is delicious, low in calories, and reasonably priced. Although the label only states that it is fat-free, it is also sugar-free. It tastes as good as any hot cocoa that contains fat and sugar, yet contains far fewer calories. Try it!"
2,Weak,I found this coffee very weak - I had to lower the cup size to get some flavor.  I would not order this again.
2,Just OK,This jam has little fruit taste. If you love damson jam this is not the one for you. It could have been any flavor. All you taste is sweetness.
5,healthy and delicious,"These chips are great!  They look almost like a flattened rice cake, but taste so much better, more like a potato chip. The bbq flavor is delicious. They are very low in fat and full of flavor. It is easy to eat an entire bag of these!"
2,Good idea but too small,I thought this would be the perfect cutting board for the Brezza but it's far too small I have a hard time cutting full size vegetable on it.  Another negative is it stains easily.
4,No cap?,"The product itself is wonderful. However, when it was shipped to me, there was no cap on it. It was sealed with the foil/paper but no black plastic cap!"
5,Better price than the grocery store,I buy my office supplies from Amazon.com. When we were out of tea I thought I would check the prices on Stash teas compared to Safeway. Yup - it's cheaper here. And I can buy bulk and have it delivered directly to the office. win-win.
5,The Cadillac of Teas,Loos tea is the only way to go.  Twinnings has been consistantly excellent tea. I've been using Twinnings almost exclusively at home since my first trip to London over 30 years ago.  Their Darjeeling is most excellent. You won't be disappointed.
4,Something that actually lasts!,"My dog is a 25 lb Schnoodle who just turned 1 year old last month.  I have struggled to find a toy that she won't destroy within 2 minutes.  This is a great product!  She loves her little Dino and takes it with her everywhere.  It's a great alternative to her pigs foot that had a horrible smell.  Also, she can chew on this 24/7 and I don't have to worry about her getting sick from over feeding her on rawhides.  My only regret: My husband bought it in the store for $11.00.  Our next one will be purchased on Amazon."
5,Creamy Perfection!,"My favorite tea is Earl Grey in its many versions, but this is absolutely my favorite.  They have mastered the art of creamy without bitterness."
1,Contains Palm Fruit Oil !,"Please do not buy into this product being a pure back-to-nature good for you...good for the environment product.  IT IS NOT.  It contains palm fruit oil.  Cutting down of these forests could spell the complete demise of the orangutans as this is their habitat.  Palm fruit oil is used in soaps, cosmetics, and lots of other things - but who thought it was in this high-end peanut butter???  Amazon needs to put this information in the product listing so at least people will know what they're getting."
2,A bit disappointing,"I was hoping Bisquick got it right when they released this product, but they missed their mark.<br /><br />I made both biscuits and dumplings (chicken & Dumplings). The biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland. The dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two."
5,Vanilla Honeybush,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
5,Lovely Gift,"This is a very nicely packaged and reasonably priced item.  I gave it to my mother for Christmas 2007, and she loved it.  The pasta was so fragrant that we had to hold the dog back to keep him from tearing into it himself."
5,PURE Gardetto's Roasted Garlic Rye Chips!,"I used to eat all the garlic chips out of a bowl of Gardetto's Snack Mix, which pissed everyone off. Then one day at one of Love's Tuck Stops, I found these Gardetto's Roasted Rye Chips hanging on the rack with all the other chips, and bought a bunch. Knowing they exist, I started looking everywhere else, but never did find them in any of the stores I happened to be in. The closest Love's Truck Stop was 75 miles away, so the last time I bought a few bags, I scanned them with my iPod, and found that Amazon sells them. Plus, Amazon also has them in 8 oz bags at a lower price than the 4.75 oz bags from Love's with free shipping on a case of 12 ($29.52 = $2.46 per bag, where Love's was around $2.59, or $2.69 per bag). I see this as a win-win situation, except my wife has discovered my cache, since 12 bags are a little hard to keep secret. It's a good deal, is what I'm passing along."
1,Like Green Water,"I tried this because I can't seem to find the Gloria Jean Serenity Tea which I liked very much.  The Celestial Seasonings was very very bland.  I even tried it on the smallest cup, and it made no difference.  There is no authentic flavor here.  I was brought up drinking green tea.  I especially like the Yama Moto brand green tea, but wanted something quick and easy in a k-cup. I like the Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice so I thought I would try the green tea.  I realize that coffee and tea are a personal preference.  For me, this green tea missed the mark completely."
5,Miraculous!!,"I'm thrilled to see and feel what Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Cleanse and Nourish Shampoo, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>, have done for my hair in a single application. I have been using salon shampoos and conditioners on my hair for ages now, and been really displeased with how my hair has been looking. It's grey, very thick and wiry, and was dry and brittle to the touch, and had totally lost its sheen. One wash with Clear Ultra Shea has changed all that. My hair hasn't felt this soft in years, and it's actually shining!<br /><br />Clear Ultra Shea shampoo is dense and creamy and feels incredibly luxurious as you lather it in. I was trying to find a comparison to what it feels like, but couldn't. It definitely doesn't feel like any shampoo I've ever used before. The aroma is very subtle and quite pleasant, and I like the packaging a lot. The cylinders are sturdy, with tops that press open easily, and the shampoo stands on its feet, and conditioner on its head, so there is no confusion as to what bottle you're reaching for, half blind with no glasses on and water running down your face. I'm going to keep using Clear Ultra Shea, and those salon products will have to go bye bye."
5,Salmiak Rocks,"Being a Dutchman raised in North America there was nothing like the black salty licorice my relatives would bring me as a kid, but Salmiak Rocks, didn't discover them well into my adult life.  Boy oh boy, these are incredible!  I'm making up for the many years I didn't know about these.  Taste sensation, I'm thinking of moving to Holland near the factory that makes them!"
5,These are awesome!,"My Shelties LOVE these things! And they are so ""bitty"" I don't have to break up a huge cookie. They are the perfect size for rewards."
5,ZiwiPeak Real Meat Dog Food,This product is so very convenient when traveling to dog shows.  High quality and the dogs love it. I received this product quickly and just as I expected.
5,"Warm, Fragrant and Soothing","I really like this tea.  It has a naturally sweet taste without the use of any added sweeteners.  (There are no artifical sweeteners added to this tea.  Check out the complete ingredients list shown in the Label Information area.)<br /><br />I don't find the licorice flavor to be overly strong, but you will need to like the flavor of licorice to enjoy this blend.  The hint of cinnamon, ginger and pepper adds a touch of warmth to the blend, while the orange, clove and cardamom boost the spicy sweetness of the tea.  This is now my favorite organic herbal tea and I can't wait to try the Egyptian Licorice Mint tea too."
5,spicy,We serve this mustard at the Golden City Brewery.  we got one tiney bottle once and everyone liked it so much we now order the 1 gallon jars in bulk.  Goes great on our bratwurst.
5,Yummy,We really like these. The lemon flavor is heavenly. The cookies are crisp and light... VERY VERY good.
5,Great price - Arrived quickly,This is my dog's breakfast every day.  It is exactly the same product as purchased for much more money in the pet stores.  It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I'll order this again and again.
4,Kind of a life-saver,"I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and being a vegetarian, tofu and eggs were my only pure-protein options and I grew sick of those very soon. Discovered this protein powder and have been using it in my cooking ever since. I have added it to soups, stews, curries and smoothies. I am yet to try making rotis with it.  I prefer it cooked in my meal than in smoothies. It is better used with something that already has an overpowering taste. The product's website says it CAN be used in cooking, so I assume the nutrient value is not lost by doing so.<br /><br />I think it is a little high on sodium, but atleast it gives me more options in my food now. I have not tried any other protein powders, so I don't know how it rates compared to others in the market taste-wise."
4,Not Meant for Small Dogs,"I was anxious to have our 18lb dog try these wholesome treats made with organic lamb, barley,carrots, apples and molasses. Our dog never refuses a treat, and so I anxious to have him try these healthy ones.  The treats are very big and very hard! Rectangular in shape with a perforation at the center, they are easy to break in half too hard to break any further unless you use a hammer and smash them.<br /><br />Our dog struggled, but was persistent and managed to eventually chew it and eat it. He liked them, but I would not buy them again, because of their size. Really intended for larger dogs in my opinion, so we will end up giving them to our neighbor's large dog to enjoy."
1,Coffee Direct Mexican Altura - Avoid!,"I ordered 5 lbs. of this (with which I am stuck now), expecting a typically mild Mexican coffee.  Instead, this Mexican Altura was virtually tasteless, with no aroma, no body -- all in all, not even an acceptable blending coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWFAGO"">Coffee Bean Direct Mexican Altura, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a>"
5,Don't stop using these just because your baby get older!,"I give these to my toddler, call them Applesauce, and he loves them still.  They are the perfect on-the-go snack, they take no prep, don't need to be refrigerated, and even have vegetables.  I'll use this over a bag of chips any day of the week."
5,The BEST Turkey every!!!,"Once I found Turkey Perfect Herb Brine Mix, I will never make another turkey any other way.  This is hands down the BEST Turkey every.  Now I have to make a bigger bird every year because there is never enough leftovers.  Buying a mix that is ready to go is not only the easiest way to do it, it is also the least expensive because buying individual herbs are expensive."
5,Confessions Of A Die-Hard Coffee Drinker,"Good Earth Green Tea - Lemongrass<br /><br />No way, no how, was I ever going to be a tea drinker. Coffee was my perker-upper of choice, and loved every jittery cup of it. I still like my morning cup and the aroma of good coffee brewing in the morning. Whenever offered tea by friends I'd always decline - ""coffee if you've got it please"". I would settle for the last of a pot that had been heating for hours rather then try tea. So to say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant, or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. So when I say I Love This Tea - you can be sure that's the truth as well.<br /><br />It started with a coupon. It was a bargain to pick some up at my local market, and thought well, maybe I should have some on hand for all those tea lovers I know. Hearing so much about the benefits of green tea, I picked out a box of it and put it up on a shelf. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on this Good Earth Lemongrass. This one I loved.It was the best I tried. So naturally my next stop was here at Amazon. And naturally I found this great deal.<br /><br />The taste is wonderful and so is the aroma. Light and citrusy, but slightly sweet - not what I thought ""lemongrass"" would be.I didn't need to add anything at all. It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffe per serving. It gives me a renewed and refreshed energy in the afternoons without any jitteryness.It also doesn't seem to be  dehydrating -as coffee can be.Not to mention the other health benefits. According to the box, this blend is rich in antioxidants. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />Ingredients: Green Tea,Lemongrass,Natural Flavors,Rose petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />As I said, Amazon has the best deal. I bought the six pack of 25 bag boxes-<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG"">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. One box comes out to be less then the 20 bag box sold at my market.<br /><br />Oh and on the tag of each bag(which are slit to sit on the edge of the cup) are some delightful and inspiring quotations or proverbs that may start you out with a smile. Here are a couple of them I'll leave this review with:<br /><br />""You will never be alone with a poet in your pocket""...John Adams<br /><br />""Flowers leave some of their fragrance in the hand that bestows them""...Chinese Proverb<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie"
4,Refreshing summer beverage,"I purchased this item when it was on sale.  I wasn't certain if I'd like it but I've read so much about the health benefits of green tea I wanted to try it.  This is a nice, pleasant beverage. The flavor isn't too strong.  I add a packet of Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  The powder dissolves easily in cold water.  The flavor is natural not fake.  I was impressed enough with it that I have signed up for auto-delivery."
5,My mother loved it,I got this basket as a mothers day gift. It arrived on time and intact. My mother loved the contents and the overall design. It is very girly but with a touch of sophistication. For the money a very good gift for that special lady in your life.
5,The real deal,"My husband and I first purchased this exact same vinegar at the factory/shop in Castelvetro di Modena, the tiny town in Italy where the vinegar is made. We were able to taste the various grades (ages) of vinegar right there in the shop, and this ""mid-grade"" version was actually our favorite. Back home, when we were near the end of the bottle, I researched online to see if I could find the same vinegar, as we were spoiled and knew that now no other balsamic would substitute. I was overjoyed to find it was available via Amazon! This vinegar is a perfect balance of sweet and sour. The maker described it as ""everyday"" meaning the one you would use for salads and such. It is not as sweet or thick as the older versions, but sweeter and thicker than standard versions typically available in US supermarkets. I like to give house guests a taste test, starting with a tiny taste of a standard store brand that I previously thought was quite good, and then a taste of the La Vecchia Delspensa 10 yr. We also have a bottle of 20 yr from this maker, so I cap the taste test off with that. The differences between all three are dramatic. The store brand just doesn't compare at all. The 20 yr is syrupy and tastes of currents or raisins. To me, the 10 yr is ""just right""."
5,Excellent Bold Coffee,"Great coffee for those coffee lovers who like a strong cup of coffee. We use the biggest cup brew on our Breville coffee maker and have been enjoying Jet Fuel as that ""extra pick me up"" coffee in the house!"
4,Wow!  The crunchiest!,"Billed as good tasting cereal that is also nutritious, the Kashi Golean Crunch  definately delivers the crunch.  Comparing the side nutrition info panel with other cereals shows low fat, low sugar, good fiber and a fair ammount of vitamins.  As with any granola based cereal, adding rasins, bananas, berries, etc. helped vary the taste immensely.  Even so, after 6 boxes I was ready for an extended break.  I expect I will enjoy it again later.  Enjoy!"
5,Picky Eater,"Our corgi puppy is a picky eater, but she loves these treats!  They're soft and small enough that she can eat them easily even as a small pup.  Great for training."
5,Triplets love this!,This food is great!  My triplets love it.  I thought it tasted great too!  If I need to go on puree food I want this.
1,Awful Taste!,"I bought this product after reading about the benefits of it from ""First Magazine for Women."" I picked it up at Whole Foods for $5.99 and a total waste of money. The magazine touted it as good for weight loss, because the protein would fill you up and it had a lot of  B vitamins. The article said it was good spread on toast. Well the taste is very salty and extremely bitter. You could never spread enough on toast to be filling, because of the awful after taste of bitterness. Also, it is so expensive, you would have to buy a couple of jars a week if you did use it on a daily basis. The taste is like eating a combo of a bunch of anchovies and beef jerky. If you have to watch your sodium, you do not want this. I will not be buying it again."
5,One of my favorite teas,"This is a genmaicha tea...it has popped rice in it which gives a wonderful smooth flavor to the tea and is wonderful for an upset tummy. If you have never tried a genmaicha then start with this....this bag will last a really long time.  I always keep a bag on hand as I hate to run out of it.  If you like green tea, you will probably love this as it has no strong or overpowering flavor .  Very smooth."
5,No more wasted Tomato Paste,This tomato paste in a tube is the best. No more opening cans of tomato paste only to have it go bad in the refrigerator.  It's concentrated so you don't have to use much to add flavor to dishes.
5,Best all-purpose seasoning ever!,"This is by far the best all-purpose seasoning I've ever tried. I use it on everything, its especially perfect as a steak seasoning. Haven't tried it on anything that it hasn't improved - I highly recommend it on corn on the cob with some butter."
5,"After a few cans, I'm hooked.","It took two or three cans, but I love these now.  When I first tried these, I thought the taste was not as ""bold"" as I would like it to be.  I do wish they were a tad stronger and hotter on the wasabi taste, but I am hooked on these now.  I eat some almost every day."
5,The Best!,"I absolutely love these Hapi Wasabi peas!  They are delicious & satisfy my salty/spicy cravings.  Plus, they help clear out my sinuses!"
3,Product from Amazon Suspect,"Let me say I love Amazon and order a variety of products, including dog food so I thought I'd try these.<br /><br />I have been buying these for years, but this was the first time from Amazon. They smelled putrid, like oil gone bad.  I am afraid to give them to by dog.  The expiration date is good, but they smell bad. They were also extremely light.  Most I get are a bit dark beige or brown.  Not worth the risk to try these.  Maybe a bad batch.  I usually buy at vet's office, and I have never had any trouble giving them to my Yorkie or Maltese, both under 11 pounds.  Of course, never leave a dog unattended with any kind of chew stick.<br /><br />C.E.T. also has a mouth rinse.  Of course, brushing is best."
5,Apple Cider Vinegar,Excellent product with multiple health benefits. I recommend this product.  Go to google and read-up on the many benefits from the vinegar cocktail.
4,"Not the ones I got in Germany recently, but....","I ate them all anyway.  There are new flavors for gummi bears that I got in Germany in October and these were not the same, so I was a little disappointed.  But these are still better than what you get in the supermarket, so every now and then they're worth the splurge..."
5,Another great blend of whole grain goodness!,"This rice is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  I use an automatic rice cooker so there is no work or guessing involved.  I think what I like best about this rice is the texture.  It has a lot of ""crunch"" left in it after cooking.  The Pearled Barley & Rye Berries add to that crunchy texture.  I sometimes like to add a bit of wild rice to the blend as well.  This rice blend has a lot more flavor than plain, white rice.  We also know that this whole grain product is much more healthy for you than the plain white variety.  I have occasionally found this rice in some of the stores where I shop but far too often I search for it in vain.  Thankfully, I can count on Amazon to have this in stock!!!<br /><br />I also like the Rice Select Royal Blend with Brown & Wild Rice with Soft Wheat & Rye Berries.  I alternate between these two varieties to keep things interesting.  I always make a big batch of this rice because the ""planned overs"" are also very good and can be used in a number of ways!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS DOG FOOD!  CAUSES PANOSTEITIS,"My poor 4-month old yellow lab puppy has Panosteitis after eating Orijen puppy food for large breeds.  The vet says it's caused by too much protein, and this is the only food he's eaten for 2 months."
5,love it love it love it. i just love milk,"53 bucks for 1.75 gallons what a sweet deal. i couldnt be any more happy about my purchase. i get to drink this milk with my favorite cookies while i watch sponge bob square pants. i love, shlub and glub this milk."
5,Very Tasty!,"Nice serving size, good complement to breakfast.  Low in fat, high in protein, and taste great.  I keep the unused portion in the freezer and microwave them, or heat them in a pan if you want a crispier outside.  They are pre-cooked.  Love 'em!"
4,It's okay,"I've been eating healthy foods almost exclusively for the past 7 years, so I end up eating things like this when I need a snack.  It's whole grain and has the lowest salt content of just about any cracker-type product that I can find, i.e., it's a reasonably healthy food.  Of course, the downside is that it doesn't taste  good.  I couldn't possibly eat it plain.  Instead, I spread on some healthy (i.e., no salt, no sugar, etc.) peanut butter, homemade hummus, or homemade guacamole.  That makes for a decent (but certainly not delicious) snack.  I often wonder if all this healthy eating is worth it."
5,Very unique take on peanuts.,"I saw these and simply had to try them. I mean c'mon, eat the shells??? Well, turns out, they are very good. Now not everyone will enjoy them, I'm sure. My only issue, and it is pretty minor, but the garlic flavor could have been a bit stronger for my taste. Over all though, these are a very neat take on peanuts."
5,Looking for a flavored cappucino type K-Cup>? Here it is,Yummy chocolate coffee cappucino type Keurig K Cup. It's lush and rich with flavor (use the 8 oz setting)  and it tastes amazing. I like it as well as the coffee bar mochas and this only is only 60 calories. LOVE IT!!
4,Great packaging,The food comes in a nice size box. The food is sercured an nicely organized. My kitty loves both the food an is curently playing in the boxes. It also ships fast every time.
5,Too lazy to pick your own cherries?,"Then get this. This has to be the best canned food product on the planet!<br /><br />Great for sundry uses like pie, tarts, or topping. Or eat right out of the can."
5,Wonderful Tea,"This black tea is bold, yet smooth.  I highly recommend it if you like tea.  If you like warm water.. find a nice herbal."
5,Diet Cola Syrup,Good stuff. I wish they would run a special on it though. I liked it. it is all i can find. locally i cannot find any cola syrup. but it tastes pretty good to me. i always wait until the price is right then i grab a few. i enjoy drinking it.
3,St Patrick's Day Buttons,Buttons were much smaller than expected and did not receive before St Patrick's Day even when I requested priority delivery and was willing to pay for faster service.  No response from seller when asked if shipment could be rushed.
5,The Cherry Chocolate Bumble Bar is my favorite!,"The Cherry Chocolate is my favorite Bumble Bar!!!  You must try this one if you like the taste of sweet chocolate and cherries all in one bar.  My son loves this one too.  Great quality product, and a yummy healthy snack!"
4,Fantastic product but way too expensive on Amazon,"As other's have mentioned, this is available in other stores for much cheaper so I recommend to shop around before buying on Amazon.<br /><br />When it comes to the actual product, I highly recommend buying this if you own a Keurig. You are able to discretly hide so many of the Keurig cups. The carousel is a neat product but when you don't have counter space, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />This unit is pretty great quality but I do find that it is tough to slide sometimes. The material that they use on the top of the tray makes sure that your Keurig doesn't move at all.<br /><br />Highly recommend that you pick one up whether it be from BBB or Amazon!"
2,Has an unpleasant taste....,"I was disappointed in the quality of this coffee.  It has a weird whang to it - a bitter taste.  My husband tried it and said the same thing.  I don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but I won't be using this coffee except for emergency backup (when I'm out of good coffee)."
5,Still the best,"I've tried a lot of different beef jerky products, including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ51NA"">Mr. Z Beef Jerky</a> from Amazon, as well as the store brand from Jewel, and a great many others, including buffalo jerky like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48P4U"">Golden Valley Buffalo Jerky </a>. Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion."
5,Great Product!,"My Jack Russell, Rusti, loves these chews. She's a very, very picky eater- even with treats. But she goes nuts over Indulgence Dingos. I once tried giving her a regular Dingo chew (I had ran out of the Indulgence Dingo chews). She sniffed the regular chew, then walked away- but not until first looking up at me with that look that says ""You're got to be kidding me, right?"""
2,Harsh taste; why do people equate it with good coffee.,"I thought this was a good value.  Starbucks has a name, stores, and the price was good.  I should have saved my money and bought the equal amount of Dunkin Donuts brand whole beans cause it is so much better than this stuff.<br /><br />This coffee lacks even subtle character of Diner coffee.<br /><br />It is harsh on the pallet and coats your tongue.  French roast?  I never tasted anything this bad in France.  This is more akin to the coffee you may buy in India."
4,Great Treats for your Googie!,"I received Bit-O-Luv today and decided to use it as a training treat for my puppy Jager.  The pieces are a soft jerky type in nice little rectangular pieces that can be used as training treats.  My Jager liked the Bit-O-Luvs, they are not smelly and look very much like jerky.  I gave Jager half a rectangle to see how they taste, he definitely like the taste since he was happy and jumped up for the rest of the treat."
1,Daybreak Morning Blend,"In my opinion, this is not good coffee- I've tried it plain and tried ""doctoring"" it, but cannot bring myself to drink a cup of it."
5,Perfect!,"It runs on the spicy and salty side, but it has a robust flavor and the spices are balanced. One can use a bit of Indian yogurt cheese to tone it down a bit. I've used a variety of vegetables. I think that one can use just about anything. I prefer cauliflower and peas in this mix.<br /><br />The only down fall, is that the spices in the packet that one adds, are extremely strong and they should be removed prior to serving."
3,A little unbalanced,"I love good strong coffee. It's a combination on how it's roasted and the beans used. This coffee is just way too strong. It is unbalanced and though isn't bitter (which comes from weaker coffee) it is a tad over roasted and charred tasting. Instead of tasting toasty nuances you are stuck with a smack in the face. Though very good for that wake up coffee, it's not the coffee to have if you want to savor the rich and delicate nuances that many good coffees bring to the table."
2,"Easy, but not-so-tasty.","No matter what combination of water and microwaving I use, I can not make the noodles pleasant and soft like the stovetop version of Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />Quite honestly, this product is not turning out to be very palatable, which is a crying shame given that I bought it here in bulk.<br /><br />On the upside, as it is, it will do in a pinch, and it's more satisfying and marginally healthier - but only marginally healthier - than, say, potato chips or other ""junk"" foods."
1,OUR DOG BECAME VIOLENTLY ILL...NOT THE 1st...,"We switched or dog to the canned All Ages food. She has had diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days. She has never been ill and is a very healthy dog - 19 years old.<br /><br />Look online and investigate this product via consumer affairs. The story is very common, some dogs even dying from GI tract infections, siezures and horrible allergies.<br /><br />We'll be switching her back to the old standby, SOJO's. She's kind of tired of it, but we know it is good for her and won't hurt her."
5,Awesome marshmallows!,"These giant marshmallows are show stoppers! If you like to roast your marshmallow and eat the outside off, you can do that like 3 times with these bad boys. They are soo big you can just keep goin! I love em! I get to have a nice big bite of marshmallow, instead of a petite little nibble from the normal sized ones."
5,Blue Dog PB&M,I have been purchasing Blue Dog's PB&M for my cocker spaniel for three years. He is an American Cocker with an allergy to poultry and poultry by-products.<br />Blue Dog has been the perfect solution and Ozzy looks forward to his cookie every evening after his walk.<br />I also enjoy the wonderful molasses smell of the cookies. So they provide enjoyment for both of us.
4,Good Variety! What I wanted.,"The cost of this is excellent when you include it under super shipper savings. You can't beat the price of a variety of coffees. I did get a lot of one brand and a lot of one type over others, but expected that. It came in a brown paper bag, stapled shut. I didn't mind that at all, I just dump it all in my K-cup drawer anyway! I will purchase again. Here is what I got:<br /><br />8 - Green Mountain Gingerbread<br />5 - Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice<br />3 - Green Mountain French Vanilla<br />1 - Green Mountain Carmel Vanilla Cream<br />2 - Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />2 - Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 - Gloria Jean French Vanilla<br />3 - Gloria Jean Hazelnut<br />1 - Gloria Jean Butter Toffee<br />2 - Kahlua: Kahlua Original<br />1 - Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />Denise"
4,Good and Good!,"Good, though not my fav.  I will keep it in my stash for my cup of jo padres, however, I love the ""donut people"" coffee the best!  Keurig is the bombdiggity.  How did we survive before the k-cup???"
5,ryvita crackers,I love the sesame ryvita crackers. They are great with everything and little ingredients. You will love the flavor. I signed up for the automatic shipment since I want to have them on hand all the time. They make great PB&J sandwiches.
4,How to make this mix better,"This mix was ok -- for gluten free.  Which means is still was a bit dense and dry.  But I experimented with it and got a better than real cake result.  Instead of using the directions on the box, combine the mix with 1 package of instant chocolate pudding mix, 4 eggs, 1/2c vegetable oil, and 1 1/4 c cola. Beat for two minutes on medium, pour into greased 9x9 pan (or larger, my cake was very thick), and bake on 350 for 35-45 minutes.  The cake is moist and spongy and you can mix and match the pudding mixes and colas."
5,My Frenchie Loves This Food!,"I've been feeding my French Bulldog puppy Wellness Super5Mix Just for Puppy since I brought my him home with terrific results.<br /><br />Wellness passed the puppy taste test with flying colors and my pup loves dinner time! He happily scarfs-down his entire meal during feedings. The individual pieces are small enough that even at 12 weeks he as able to safely and easily eat this food.<br /><br />Wellness claims that their food is ""fit for human consumption"" and while I'm not keen on testing that claim the ingredient list is impressive. Real pieces of meat - not byproduct as in cheaper foods. No fillers like corn and wheat which can cause allergies are present at all. Also, Wellness doesn't use any dyes in their puppy food. The food is a nice consistent brown color.<br /><br />My puppy has a nice healthy coat, isn't itchy and best of all he has plenty of energy.<br /><br />Wellness is a bit more expensive, but in my experience it's worth every penny to keep my pup happy & healthy."
3,Just ok,I bought this brand because it was all they had at Ranch 99 near us. I find it spicy (hot) but not enough flavor. I would have rather bought Maesri Thai Green Curry Paste. It is much much more flavorful and spicy.
5,Top notch snack!,"In my search for healthy snacks I found this item: Organic, high in fiber, low in fat and they use sea salt. They sound like they should be boring, but they are just as good if not better than any pretzel out there.<br />I can eat 20 of them for only 2 points on my Weight Watchers program and that is a whole lot more than other snacks. They're very filling with a piece of cheese or two which is extremely important when watching what you are eatting!<br />I highly recommend them to anyone!"
5,Loved them!,"Tastykake Coconut Juniors are the best!  Not too sweet, lots of coconut flavor, and the kake is moist, yet still holds it's shape.  I only wish they were sold in California, so I didn't have to get them through the mail...!"
5,"Deliciously Sweet, and a good price.","I love the Pacific Vanilla Chai, and love to share.  In the store, individually they are $6 to $7 each, if you find them on sale.  Purchasing a pack of 6 is much cheaper, and enables me to send them in care gift baskets to friends.<br /><br />I also like the convenience of mixing with hot water, rather than milk. Granted, milk does make a more creamy Chai, but I don't always have milk in the house.<br /><br />A perfect delicious, hot drink on a cold winter night, Yum!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,MY DOG HAS VERY SERIOUS STOMACH PROBLEMS AND THIS IS THE ONLY DRY FOOD HE CAN ACTUALLY EAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT A DOUBT!!
4,Makes me the villain,"Gracie (our miniature Dachshund) absolutely loves this ""lick stick"".  She comes running when she sees me get it out.  The only drawback is that when I put it back away, she looks  at me like I am the meanest person ever."
1,hair!,"Let me start by saying I love this tea so when I saw it for this price I had to jump on it, bad idea!  I opened it today, when I looked in the container I was like is that a hair! oh yes it was about 8 inches long and attached to two of the pearls so I dumped some tea in my hand (the amount was what I would use for one cup) and found two more hairs rolled up in the pearls.  So Dear Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf I have always been happy with both your coffee and Tea and I would be willing to pay more for your products if you promise to make your employees that deal with the Tea and coffee for that matter wear hair nets."
5,Let's put this in perspective,"You will see other reviews criticizing this syrup as not being like Lyle's.  Different uses!!  Lyle's is excellent for baking and making desserts but not for beverages.<br /><br />I like this Monin syrup to sweeten drinks!  It is awesome for that purpose.  I make fresh limeade for Margaritas with this ----way way better than a crummy store-bought Margarita mix.  Ever try to sweeten a beverage with granulated sugar?  Gross.  It doesn't melt.  All you do is add this syrup and it's great.  Great to add into iced tea too.<br /><br />Get the pump if you think you will use it to sweeten by the glass.  Otherwise you can just pour out of the bottle for larger batch drinks.  It's also really good to add into whipped cream if you are making that from scratch - but I actually prefer to use the vanilla flavored Monin for that.<br /><br />Monin syrups are high quality - I've been using them for years in my coffee (caramel, vanilla, almond, etc.) and the fruit flavored ones to make Italian sparkling sodas."
5,"sturdy dubba, decent spices","A fine masala dubba: sturdy construction, decent size(small enough to fit on a shelf), and has an inner cover. This is my first dubba, so I can't confirm the ""Superior Quality"", but it does what I need it to do and I don't imagine any reason you might be disappointed with it. I've heard that some cheaper ones arrive dented or the lids are warped, so maybe the superior quality is in the slightly thicker metal."
2,So Runny I used a straw,"I love Earth's Best line but this one is an exception. It says it's for 3rd stage, but it's so runny that it's more like 1st stage, with the exception of carrot bits in it. It was so runny I used a straw. The taste isn't bad, but this is more like soup."
4,A little harsh for my palate,"I love Italian roast coffee and wanted this in K-Cup pods to use in my Keurig maker. I have used San Francisco Bay's French Roast but could not get Italian roast in that brand. This brand is a close second to other, smoother brands of Italian roast and works well as a basis of my Latte's made with my HIC milk frother. My order arrived on time as expected with Amazon Prime."
3,Sweet but not spicy enough,"Despite its Jamaican origin, the D&G Ginger Beer is more sweet and less spicy than expected.  Certainly spicier than any of the ginger ales you will find in your neighborhood grocery stores but if you are expecting the ginger vapors to make a strong impression, you will be disappointed."
1,Stale - Hull O' Plenty - Unflavorful - I'm Out the Money :(,"I cannot believe the vendor had the nerve to sell this nasty, bottom-of-the-barrel popcorn to anyone.  Not even fit for a pig's slop."
5,Works as Advertised,"I am only giving this tea 5 stars because it delivers.  After steeping the tea bag in warm water for 5 minutes, within moments of nursing on the tea, you do begin to feel a sense of calm.  If you are a swimmer, and panicky in the water, like myself, this helps out a lot.  Do note, this tea can be habit-forming and you'll need more of it after a while to reach the same effect.  Surprisingly you do not need a prescription for this stuff.  NB, this is not the same tea you get at Starbucks, which has fuller leaves and hibiscus flowers inside, and delivers a stronger punch."
5,A Great addition to the cabinet....,"In response to ""...too salty..."" - I'd say less salty than 'seasoned salt' and more than Cavender's Greek Seasoning (another favorite). As implied elsewhere, unless you've been avoiding salt or are adding salt in prep, this will be fine for most.<br /><br />I've found this better than ""Slap yo Mamma"" and many other popular Creole seasonings, and surprisingly great to ~Flavor Up~ bland soups or pasta dishes. Not a blowtorch, just some kick and flavor.<br /><br />Go for it!"
5,Love them!!,"My husband isn't a big coffee drinker but loves ""gas station"" cappuccino.  He says these taste even better than what he's used to.  Will definately by again!!"
5,A must have if you have painful heavy periods,"I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day."
5,alderwood smoked sea salt,a wonderful salt for almost anything. is really good to put on steaks and then tenderize. makes the meat very tender and hold in juices. My favorite cooking salt by far.
5,great service,"This company went out of their way to help me.  The post office had delivered my basket to the wrong place over the busy holiday season, but the lovely staff helped me track it down.  The basket was even better then expected.<br /><br />Mahalo"
4,Good value - good price,"This product is a good value, good price.  Greenies can be much more expensive in pet food store.  Item is delivered quickly and it is sealed.  They always seem to be fresh and consistent.  I feed my dog (1) day so I go through them quickly."
5,Lawry's Spaghetti Sauce - The Best in over 40 years,"I have been using Lawry products for over 40 years. I used to live in Calif. and I believe there was a restaurant called Lawry's-The Prime Rib. I think I ate there over 60 years ago.<br />I have tasted the canned and jared spaghetti sauces, and they can't hold a candle to Lawry's. This is my third case of 24 packs that I have bought from Amazon, and I am really enthusiastic about their subscription program to this product.<br />Easy to use, and tastes like home. I have grown so used to this spaghetti sauce mix that I don't like any other spaghetti."
5,super!!,"If you have not eaten this product you are missing a great treat.  Add a chopped chicken breast, serve on tortilla with hot sauce and cheese...marbelous meal with salad."
5,Great Dog Food,This dog food is nutritious and light. Unusually great tasting as my dog is a very picky eater but loved this stuff.  Inexpensive for the weight of the bag too.
1,Doesn't fit Keurig,I don't know if this is good coffee or not. The one star is to warn other buyers that these pods do not fit a Keurig coffee maker.
4,Reminds me of a good trail mix,"I admit, I was skeptical when I saw these were coming. They screamed ""health food"" which my experience has taught me usually did not mean tasty. I was incorrect. Very incorrect. They aren't a large bar, probably similar in size to a store bought, cheap granola bar. What they lack in size, they make up for in taste. These bars are jam packed with flavors I wasn't expecting. All kinds of sweet and tangy fruit bits, like cranberry and blueberry float freely in the mix. Plenty of nuts to get a solid crunch from, like almonds. There are some oats and probably the part I liked best: sunflower seeds. One of the most underrated pieces in the bar. But all of these mixed together hold tight.<br /><br />The biggest challenge I had with these, was getting them out of the package. They are probably packed right after being formed, so the honey-like substance holding everything together sticks to the wrapper. I do mean sticks. It could take me a good 30 seconds to get the bar out of the wrapper, but aside from some sticky spots on the wrapper, nothing from the bar stuck to it or to my fingers. Which is great compared to a lot of other bars out there.<br /><br />So it's a great bar, filled with flavors that really remind me of a good trail mix, in a bar form. They're just a little small for me and take a little too long to get out of the wrapper."
5,YUM YUM,"Who doesn't like Hostess cup cakes! The cakes are individually packaged, so one isn't tempted to eat a second one, like what is in the grocery stores."
5,Olde Thompson Pepper Supreme,"This is, by far, the best tasting pepper I've ever had. This company also offered it at the best price I could find."
5,Just what I needed,"This is a great addition to my Torani syrup. It does add a little bit of height (some reviewers complained about this) but my countertop height accomodates it, so no complaint here. I like that I get the same amount each time with no spills or drips. I think it's perfect."
3,It's just OK,"One of my kids liked this product, one of them did not. I found it... almost powdery tasting. The flavor was nice. It just wasn't anything that made me say ""Wow this is a really great bar!""  But it wasn't bad and the box was finished rather quickly. Worth a try."
4,Great breakfast cereal,"Brand Buds is one of the few cereals that is high in fiber and somewhat low in sugar yet has a decent amount of vitamins. This is a good tasting cereal with plenty of crunch. If you like your cereal chewey,just microwave with one teaspoon of water for 30 to 40 seconds and the crunch is gone,add cold milk and enjoy!"
5,best olive oil,"I first tasted on a restaurant in Sorrento . "" Il Bucco"" one of the finest in that town. The taste is amazing well worth the price. Do not use it for cooking , it is too fine."
5,Mild sausages,I love this product and order it quite often for my big boys to take hunting. Just wish the seller would take the time and money to change the label to say Mild instead of spicy. It isnt spicy and they have at least put a sticker on the package but have not changed the discription on line so I thought I was actually purchasing spicy this time. Still a wonderful product.
5,Create a custom cereal blend,"I mix one-half serving of Ezekiel 4:9 with one-half serving of Kashi""U"", add sliced banana or fresh blueberries and skim milk or plain Greek yogurt. Healthy, interesting textures, flavorful combination. This cereal varies widely in price, depending on where you shop. Amazon has a very reasonable price on the six-pack for this nutritional and convenient product.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKYX48"">Food For Life Ezekiel 4:9 Organic Sprouted Grain Cereal, Golden Flax, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
5,Wonderful Tea,"I use red clover tea a lot and so do my friends, it helps cure insomnia and is also known as a cleanser of the body organs. I feel rejuvenated, refreshed and cheerful after I use it, which is between once a week and once a month."
5,marvelous,"I thought the other 2 spreads these people make were great, but this one is even better--they are all wonderful in the morning on english muffins."
5,Great Low Acid French Roast Coffee,"If you're looking for a coffee that is kind to your stomach, you may wish to try this. I make decaf iced coffee each morning with almond milk, a tablespoon of cocoa and stevia for sweetener. This coffee is tasty, satisfying and smells good. I love hazelnut and french vanilla coffee so will be exploring any flavored coffees this company makes, along with this French Roast. I enjoyed it as a base for my daily iced coffee. What a great idea to design a low-acid coffee!"
2,Inconsistent Gunpowder Green Tea,"I ""subscribed"" to this gunpowder green tea. The first pound was pretty good, and was what one expects from ""gunpowder"" tea... each leaf was tightly rolled into a ball as it is suppose to be. The second pound that I received does not look like gunpowder tea at all. Simply hard little blobs of nearly flavorless tea. NOT the same quality as the first pound. This all sounds like tea-snobbery, I know. But when buying loose tea, one should be able to expect consistency. I am going to cancel my subscription. Unfortunate- I would have been a customer for life."
4,THESE ARE VERY GOOD,"These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.<br /><br />The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier."
5,A fine cup of English Tea!,Most of the Earl Grey blends that you find in the USA lack the bite of the orange peco and black tea that is prevalent in the home country. This is EG how it should be with a strong orange aroma and plenty of flavor. Note these are individual bags for use in a tea pot with no string for ducnking in a cup. Enjoy.
3,Caution: not for toy breeds or puppies!,We discovered this after receiving it and reading the label.  It should be in the item description here so consumers can make intelligent purchases!
2,Worked fine but only shortly,"My dog had an increased interest in his food for a very short time after using this product, then he got tired of it like he does everything. So the search continues..."
5,Awesome-ness!,These markers are super fun!!! They even write on cheese! By far my new favorite way to make my lunch more fun!!!
4,These are really tasty,These do taste like peanut butter bars just a little dry.  Do these bars in it shares to take away that hunger feeling.  It supposed to be hell food too that's great.
5,The most delicious noodle soup around.,"I am a noodle fan.  I can enjoy almost any kind of noodle.  Spaghetti, ramen, Pho, Pad thai, you name it.  But this Nongshim Neoguri reign supreme.  I will gladly eat this any day any time any occasion. This thing is that good."
4,Cascadian Farm Organic - Honey Nut O's Corn Free Recipe! 10.4 oz.,"I went browsing thru Publix's Greenwise organic section for a whole grain cereal that wasn't too heavy in both flavor and bulk.<br /><br />I bought their corn free recipe in the tall 10.4 oz size.  This is an excellent cereal.  This is not your kids cheeros!<br /><br />This is a favorful, light, crunching, and fresh whole grain cereal.  It is made of oats and barley with a touch of honey, and a hit of almond flavor.<br /><br />I give this cereal a 5/5 for flavor, 5/5 for freshness, 5/5 for Earth conscious packaging (100% recycled paperboard), and 5/5 for maintaining organic integrity.  They also particpate in the Box Top for Education program.<br /><br />A serving size is 1 cup with 110 cal, 1 g fat, 170 mg sodium, 75 mg potassium, 25 g carbs, 7 g sugar,  15 g other carbs, and 2 g protein.<br /><br />Although the cereal is low in sugar (7 g) and contains 3 g of fiber, diabetics should take note of the nutrition label before consuming.  Namely, 25 g carbs and 15 other carbs which equals 40 g carbs per 1 cup serving.<br /><br />The cereal does not have adequate daily allowances and vitamins but I don't buy it for that, I mainly buy it for its organic qualities, delightful flavor, and whole grain texture.<br /><br />I didn't give them a perfect score because the packaging size does not match up with their other packages in that this box is taller than their other cereals but it only holds 10 oz, whereas their raisin bran packing is smaller but holds 14 oz.  This gives the impression that you are actually getting more for your money, but you are actually getting less."
5,Delicious!,"I would order these again in a heartbeat!  Amazingly good - can't even tell they're vegan!  To be honest, I ordered these as a gift for someone but they looked so good that I ate them and had to re-order!  Highly recommend."
5,flax seed meal,"Great product that I add to my morning health shake.  Two tsps. flax seed meal, 1/2 banana, two strawberries, 1/2 pear, 25 grams chocolate peanut butter protein powder, 1/2 tsp. cinnamin, 1 cup nonfat milk and two tsps coconut oil."
1,This is bogus,I can't believe that I have to search for these on amazon. Like srsly double u tee eff kellogs? Why can't I buy them at the supermarket like a normal human being? Spoiler aleart: these are the best pop tarts on the planet and all other pastries will taste like chocolate starfish after you have tasted the deliciousness. I miss u wild berry. U never call. I wish you the best... But I have to let you go. I don't wanna cloooose my eyes! No wait! Come back! I didn't mean to only give u a one star review... I was just hurt. That's all.

In the pastry isle... At Von's. We can watch power rangers together like old times. I know u miss me because I miss you. I'm sorry. I'm drunk texting. Don't let things get weird ok? I hope you the best wild berry.<br /><br />-Chris Isaac
5,pop chips,"I love these chips.  They are not only diet friendly but they taste really good. I will definetly buy them again, I love that they are a one serving package so I don't have to figure out how many I can eat at a sitting."
4,Less stomach upset than the Healthy Weight version,"We have 3 large dogs, 2 being pure bred hunting labs (one rescued from a shelter) and the 3rd a mixed breed (also rescued from a shelter). The largest of our 3 dogs (7 years old and about 70lbs) has an ultra sensitive stomach. When we first got him as a young dog, we tried giving him different vet recommended dog foods, but after months of non-stop gas and runny doggy doo, it was the original Beneful formula that we found he seemed to do best with. Our smallest/oldest/mix-breed dog (11 years old and about 25lbs) does well on any dog food he's given, and so has never had any troubles eating Beneful either. Our youngest dog (about 50lbs and 3 years old) does get some minor gas from time to time with every dog food we have ever given to her, including Beneful. While the other two dogs are both slim and muscular, she's quite pudgy (for a lab) even with all the exercise she constantly gets. At one point we decided to move her to the Beneful Healthy Weight version of this dog food to see if it would help her lose a few pounds. We kept her on it for about 2 months, and while she did lose a little weight, she had non-stop terrible has and upset stomachs. So much so that she went from a very happy cheerful dog to one that seemed miserable and uncomfortable all the time. Within a few days of switching her back to this Beneful Original formula, she was her happy, playful, active self again. It's not the best quality, most expensive dog food on the market, but it's affordable, my dogs enjoy the taste and it doesn't make them sick or uncomfortable like some other brands/versions do."
5,Fantastic,"This stuff is completely fantastic! It's the only completely peanut & dairy free almond spread out there and it is soooo yummy! What a great company for people with allergies. Now my son can actually eat nut butter and jam sandwiches. They also have other products that you can find on their website. p.s. when they say crunchy, they mean crunchy. There are a lot of almond pieces in it. Which I love but I'm also excited to try the smooth kind. :) Happy Eatin!"
4,Great for brisket,"The moppin' sauce works great for slow-smoked brisket.  I added a little extra cider vinegar and some beer that I, uh, ""happened"" to have handy, and let the wood chips and time do the rest."
5,Delicious!,"It's hard to find flavors in Decaf, but this is a great combo and they are both delicious! I love that I can still enjoy my coffee without the caffeine. Great product!"
1,one star for POOR SERVICE but good product,"My 2 yr old terrier mix has been eating this food since she was a puppy. She loves it & we love it because since switching over to this her skin is no longer pink and itchy! HOWEVER THIS SELLER IS TERRIBLE....Placed order for ""just a wee bit"" dog food. In-stock item was estimated to be delivered a week later. Well a week later when I was supposed to have received my order I instead received an email from amazon stating they could not give me tracking info because seller had not confirmed that the item had yet been shipped! I contacted seller asking when I would be receiving the order and they did not reply! Meanwhile I ran out of my dogs food and I had to drive all around town looking for a store that carried this brand! (hard to find in my area, which is why I usually order online...usually through amazon from ProbioticSmart, but I tried to save a few bucks with PetcareRx...never again"
5,better than expected.,a family member is recovering from an illness and a bite here and there of just about anything is important.  I was pleasantly surprised that this is a stick of cheese OR a stick of meat.  Healthy? maybe not so much but not just empty calories either.  Protien in any form helps provide that all important positive nitrogen balance for healing.
4,So durable! But...,"This thing has lasted 2 months and still going strong! We have a 1yr old pittmix & loves to chew. He rips rawhide in a matter of seconds but after reading how dangerous rawhide is we were looking for other options. We bought this, he loves it! One thing - after 2 months he chewed this thing into sharp corners & points that if he comes to play with you with it is like a weapon! We all lift our legs on the couch to avoid scratches! However, he loves it, he spends time with it and it is super durable so we are all happy! :D"
5,YUMMY Barney Butter is DEE-LISH-US!,LOVE these little portion controlled packets!  I could EASILY sit down & eat a jar of this stuff all at once.  EVER-SO-YUMMY!  Buy this stuff 'cause you'll LOVE it!
5,Lifesaver for a diabetic,I am diabetic and quite often need something to grab that is lower carb and sugar but with a good protein base.The taste is great and its very easy to pop in my bag and go on and busy day. This is the only flavor I have tried and I really like it.
2,Naked coco water sucks,"I've been a fan of coconut water since I was a kid and until recently, other than getting it straight from a coconut, it was hard to find pure coconut water drinks without a bunch of additives and sugars (although I enjoy those too). needless to say, after trying my first brand (O.N.E.), I've been on a coco water rampage. I've tried vita coco, amy and brian's, blue monkey, zico, c20, O.N.E., etc. most are good, some are whatever (zico, vitacoco). vitacoco has days in which it tastes ok and some days I must be getting bad packages cus they suck.<br /><br />Naked, however, sucks every. single. time. it hardly has that distinctive coconut scent/taste. good coconut water is supposed to be even more refreshing than water after a good work out but I don't enjoy the taste of Naked at all.<br /><br />unfortunately for customers, coconut water comes at a premium price and is hardly affordable per fluid oz, so if you're going to shell out $$$ to get some, get something worthwhile, like O.N.E., C2O, or blue monkey coconut water."
3,Mixed feelings...,"I originally tried this product because the ""oil-free"" caught my eye.<br />Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!<br />But after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...<br />CONS:<br />  -This product doesn't sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and greasy.<br />  -My acne continued to break out, even more! :(<br />PROS:<br />  -Made my skin feel softer :)<br />  -Very long lasting, don't let the 3oz fool you!<br /><br />OVERALL: I stopped using this product after using about 1/4 of it. But hey, everyone has a different type of skin.<br />  If you feel that this moisturizer might be the one for you, go on and try it!"
5,purchase,Excellent product and an exceptional value.  Very pleased with the item and service. Will consider a similar purchase in the future.
4,Delicious and Satisfying Jelly Beans...,"I received my pouch as part of a birthday gift basket from my parents.  Problem is my birthday isn't until November 29th.  I just so happen to be home when the Amazon delivery arrived and opened the box expecting it to be my own order ... only to find delicious Jelly Beans!  Early Birthday present win!  Anyhow, onto the review!!<br /><br />Jelly Belly Jelly Beans are easily my favorite snack food on the planet.  These little beans come in a wide variety of flavors, 49 for this 2-pound pouch.  Flavors such as: Green Apple, Mango, Raspberry, Red Apple, Plum, Kiwi, Peach, Coconut ... and Wild Flavors like: Buttered Popcorn, Bubble Gum, Dr. Pepper, French Vanilla, Toasted Marshmallow.  The pouch has a guide telling you what each jelly bean flavor is, and looks like.  Often included with gift box / sampler varieties of Jelly Belly is a small card that tells you how to make flavor combos to enhance your Jelly Bean experience.  A prime example wouldbe  Very Cherry.  By itself it is a very rich - cherry flavor.  However take 1 cherry + 1 Dr. Pepper and you now have  Cherry Dr. Pepper flavor.<br /><br />* POUCH DESIGN *<br />The pouch itself is quite durable and does a decent job when put into a ""standing"" position, however I wouldn't trust it.  Once you start to devour the beans inside the package becomes less and less stable.  The great thing about this package design is that Jelly Belly saw this happening and included a resealable zipper inside the pouch.  This zipper seal is quite durable and passed my spill test; I sealed the pouch then turned it upside-down with all 2-lbs of beans in it over a bowl, then began to shake and try to break the seal.  No failure.<br /><br />* JELLY BEAN QUALITY *<br />Now for the main event, the Jelly Belly's themselves.  The jelly belly's I got were excellent quality as I am used to with the Jelly Belly brand.  There is no comparison between a Jelly Belly bean and a generic jelly bean you find in the supermarket.  Jelly Belly beans are richly flavored, with each flavored bean having a distinct flavor to it.  This isn't just some sugary bean you pop into your mouth and enjoy a sweet treat.  Each tiny bean is packed with flavor, and by having 49 distinct flavors (plus mix n' match combos) the variety makes each portion of jelly beans a flavorful adventure.<br /><br />I will admit that not all the Jelly Bean flavors are my favorite.  I am not a fan of Cappuccino, crushed pineapple, or Strawberry Daiquiri plus I'm mixed on others... But that is what will happen when you have 49 unique flavors.  I will list all the flavors at the end of the review as well as nutritional information in the ""Comment"" section associated with this review.<br /><br />** OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars.  While the jelly beans are outstanding and still continue to be my favorite snack food of all time, it is an expensive product.  This was purchased on sale for about $11 or $5.50/lb (11/14/2011).  In a way that's a pretty decent price for Jelly Belly beans per pound, even when compared to some of the warehouse stores out there, but still very expensive if you compare it to a simple 24oz tin of generic jelly beans at the local supermarket for $2.99.  Despite Jelly Belly beans having a high  ""per pound"" cost, they are worth the asking price in my opinion(I wouldn't pay more than around $7.99/lb though).  The quality is exceptional and the variety of flavors make Jelly Belly beans truly a Gourmet Treat."
5,Very Very moist beans,"These bean smelled so fresh, they were moist and plump.  I'm very impressed with the quality of the beans that were shipped to me.  I can't wait to use them in all of my baked goods!"
1,Not LOW CARB and YUCK,"These are not low carb, which is the reason I purchased them.  My fault, I guess for not looking closer.  Also, they are terrible tasting.  About 1/4 way through the bag I couldn't stand them.  That's saying a lot because I LOVE food."
5,yum yum yum,"I had tried this tea when I bought it in a grocery store and like all revolution teas, it was not cheap!! Buying it on amazon let me buy more of it at less cost.<br /><br />I love this tea - it's very subtle - delicate earl grey flavors with a hint (HINT) of lavender. the other lavender earl grey's i've tried have been much too heavy on the lavender side. This one has a nice blend of both. It needs just a hint of sweetener or sugar/honey and it's perfect. It's good with milk or without. It is a black tea so has caffeine, but it's still relaxing - perfect for a stressful day at work where you don't want to be tired but want something mentally soothing."
5,I smell like a girlscout cookie!,"I bought this product to use an as alternative to lotions (I have pretty bad eczema) So far it's working well, and it smells like Samoa girl scout cookies (It smells MUCH better on your skin than it does straight out of the jar, so don't get turned off by the smell until it's on you).<br /><br />It hardens at room temperature, so be prepared to soak the bottle in hot water for a few minutes to get it out. I poured some into a little mason jar for easy access, Now I'll just use it like one of those lotion bars.<br /><br />Recently read that you can even use coconut oil as a deodorant. I don't really need an antiperspirant So I'm going to try this as a deodorant and see how I like it.<br /><br />Great product, will definitely purchase again for skin care."
5,Great strong flavor,"I agree with the company motto ""A Natural Obsession"".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food."
4,Great New Experience,"I purchased a can of Bar Harbor Clam Chowder at a local Giant Eagle.  I didn't realize ""Manhattan Style"" was different from the usual clam chowder.  At first I was disappointed, but then I tried it.  This is a wonderful soup and a great new experience from the typical clam chowder.  Unlike what I am used to this is not a creamed soup, but has the taste of tomato soup (it contains clam, clam stock, tomato, cellery, and potatoes).  Overall, I thought it was wonderful.<br /><br />I plan to try other Bar Harbor products.  It has been a LONG time since I've had a good Lobster Bisque and I think Bar Harbor can deliever."
5,"Dark, rich and my morning wakeup","I used to order my coffee from Kauai, but now I order this coffee from Amazon. I like a dark, bold coffee and this one fits the bill.  It's not bitter at all.  I've tired lots of K-Cup coffees, and this one has become my very favorite.  I hope it doesn't get discontinue, because I'm spoiled.  I especially love that my orders ship automatically, so that I don't run out."
5,My cat goes bananas for Temptations,"I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations."
5,"""Deliciously Addictive""","Besides the fact that they taste amazing...hot and sweet, they are good for motion sickness. They stick to your teeth in a way that the flavor can be savored for awhile. Yummy! Probably the best ""candy"" I've ever had!"
5,Great Belgian waffle batter!,"I purchased this mix to use with my new Presto FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker and am very pleased with the results.  It took 3 cups of this mix to make 6 large Belgian Waffles and they cooked to perfection after only 4 minutes!  The flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like Bisquick.  I'll be buying more, for sure!"
5,Coconut Curry Chicken Unexpectedly Amazing!,"I saw these pouched soups while I was shopping at Wal-Mart and was surprised to see that they were not only Campbell's brand soups but how  out of left field the flavor choices were for Campbell's. While different, that didn't immediately make me confident that the flavors would actually be successful.<br /><br />I decided to buy only one pouch of the Coconut Curry Chicken to try it out. I like curry so if this worked out yay me! Well Yay Me! This was RIDICULOUSLY good. While it was heating in the microwave (as it said to do in the directions) the fragrant aromas started seeping out. I was shocked. This smelled almost exactly like when I make coconut curry sauce on my own. It smelled so fresh and authentic, the only thing left to doubt was the taste. Surely the aroma was just some canned, chemically manufactured olfactory trick. I was happily proven wrong. The taste and the smell all fit together. And unlike Campbell's canned soups, where you had small pieces of of mushy vegetables or meat, here you had big pieces of carrots and chicken and crunchy water chestnuts, the shittake mushrooms were small however, but not negligible.<br /><br />Seriously try it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed. As for me I'm going to go buy a heck of a lot more."
5,PG Tips is great tea,PG Tips is my favorite tea.  Amazon's was fresh and reasonably priced and arrived quickly.
5,ice tea,"THis ice tea, is like heaven on ice.  must try if you love lemon and giger.  Great price for the content.  You can make a pitcher with 4 bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer.  Great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies"
5,Peachy keen!,"This is  a really nice flavor and I like that you have control over how much ,how strong you want the flavor to be. It is easy to use  and while I do not  drink alot of flavored waters I like this one. Great product!"
4,Smokehouse delivers great product - not all from USA,"We're very happy with the Smokehouse products we've ordered. The quality is top-notch. The Natural Chicken Breast Strips are our dog's favorite. He devours them. He gets a little gassy, sometimes, from them but overall he responds well to the treats.<br /><br />Warning: Not all Smokehouse products are made in the USA. We've found that they are clearly labeled. Generally, if they do not say USA in their main product description you can assume they come from China. We have made the mistake of ordering products made in China, and found that to be our mistake and not the manufacturer's.<br /><br />We have no affiliation with the company."
4,Great Soup,This takes the work out of making PHO. We do use about twice as much of the paste than the directions call for and let it steep a little longer. It is not quite as clear as some but the flavor is great. I really recommend this. This is one of my favorite products.
5,So good,"These are delicious, especially if you like cranberries and almonds. The cranberries are not too tart or sour, so they provide a nice sweetness to the bar. The whole almonds while delicious make it a little harder to chew, so if you've got fragile teeth buyer beware. I switched to these for a while from the macadamia and mango ones, which are also great, and I noticed a bigger energy boost from these, the cranberry ones. A great product. Bit pricey though, at $1.50 a bar."
5,Yum!,"I loved kettle chips from the moment I tried them but I felt absolutely disgusting every time I had the Kettle Brand. Though very tasty and crunchy, they were also very oily. With Deep River Snacks, they've got the crunch and taste without that repulsive burst of oil in your mouth with each crunch that Kettle Brand had. I LOVE the Sweet Onion Maui and Mesquite BBQ. The Jalapeno flavor does spicy justice and the Rosemary & olive Oil is very unique for a chip. I wish they had a sour cream and onion flavor but I love them regardless."
5,Delicious!!,"This natural jerky is, at this price, cheaper than the national brand you see advertised on tv, yet has LESS than half the sodium, and is gluten-free and organic! I'm a big fan of beef jerky (ok...I'm addicted to it), and this is a very tasty brand! You can't beat it at this price! Taste and texture are perfect!"
5,Mi Goreng,"Darn they still sell this... i used to eat this when i was a child, my mom (a Malaysian) would sometimes buy like 6 to 8 boxes of this noodles... and i still remember the smell and taste of it... mmmmmm... yum! I'd probably by this just cause i want to remember the good ol'days... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY THIS... SERIOUSLY!!! IT'S BETTER THAN THAT ROMEN CRAP THING..."
3,"OK taste, but very dry","I have tried the GF yellow cake, 2 different times, and both times it was very dry from the beginning.  Has a good flavor would make a good shortcake or maybe pinapple or other juicy fruit might help but not a good cupcake/birthday cake.  I like the conveince, but to dry!  Their GF Brownies are great though!!"
5,Da Bomb!,"My daughter gobbles these puffs up like they're manna from heaven... ""Puff"" is one of the first words she attempted to say... She walks around with a canister of puffs like she owns the place..."
4,Delicious and rich,"For some reason butterscotch disks have become hard to find where I live. So I turned to the trusty Internet to satisfy my craving.<br /><br />Although these looked exactly like what I'd been searching for, their difference in manufacture is evident in their taste. They taste delicious but they're richer than the brand I grew up with. This is not a bad thing; just an unexpected one.<br /><br />Meanwhile, my local grocery now stocks the candy in the flavor I'm used to. Since this was an ""old times sake"" search, I won't buy these candies online again in the near future. But that's the only reason; these candies were quite tasty."
5,GOOD STUFF!!,"You haven't eaten oatmeal until you've eaten Holly's Oatmeal.  It is so different from what you buy in the grocery stores.  It has WONDERFUL texture and flavor.  My daughter loves it, too.  In fact, I sent her a 5 pound bag of the assorted flavors as a thank you gift for having me over for meals so many times.  She was delighted.  It's almost like dessert!!"
5,Yummy Chummies are the best!,"While we were in Alaska last year we found these and brought them home to our Alaskan Klee Kai Nanook. He went nuts for them. They help us with his training and discipline.<br /><br />Could not find them in any pet store so we are very happy to have Amazon.com as our outlet for these.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G16WA0"">Arctic Paws Salmon Jerky 4 oz Yummy Chummies Jerky Treats</a>"
5,Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water,"Best tasting coconut water by far, probably because it's actually real coconut water! I drink this after my runs as well, great hydration after a workout... <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G"">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>"
5,Best candy bar ever,"I visited the theo chocolate factory in Seattle and fell in love with this chocolate bar.  It is the purest chocolate around, they do not remove any of their cocoa butter, and replace with fake emulsifiers.  I love the combination of salt, hazelnuts and chocolate.  I get one of these everytime I can.  It is a little expensive, but so worth it for pure chocolate.  The salt might scare you at first, but it combines perfectly with the chocolate.  Love this!"
5,Great dog food.,"I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price."
5,People Either Love or Hate Valerian!,"I love Valerian and I love it's earthy smell! But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!"
5,Love them,"Love these thick chips that look like real potatoes as well as taste like them. They are full of flavor and go great with any sandwich, The flavor is rich and bold and tastes great. Best part is that its not to spicey"
4,I adds that little something extra!,"I've used it now several times and it does add that little sometime extra to my dishes, in a positive way.  Recipes and big mame chefs don't mention it, but here's that one item that brings the taste of N.O., La. back to me."
5,Energy Drink vs Red Bull,"I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.  Quite impressed on just how I can't really tell the difference between this Energy Drink Sodamix and Red Bull, other than the price.  On average I spend about $2.25 per can of Red Bull, and this Sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings, so easy math says $112 for 50 cans of Red Bull or $6.99 for the Sodastream Energy Drink Sodamix 16.9 Fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings.  And as not to be biased, I have a few friends who also drink Red Bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products, and how much money could be saved."
4,Tasty!,"This may not be ""real"" cappuccino, but I am not sure I know what that is.  This tastes good and I really enjoy a cup of it, especially on these chilly mornings."
5,Good Stuff!,"A friend gave me a couple of these ""energy"" type bars last year and I immediately liked them a lot. But the prices at the local health stores and bicycle/mountain stores prohibited me from buying them as much as I wanted to. Amazon stepped in and I bought them by the box at a very decent price.<br /><br />I like to have them on bicycle rides and I'll eat one half-way through and I feel a little ""lift"" immediately afterward.<br /><br />Taste good, filling - ya oughta get some."
5,so this is what oolong tea is suppost to taste like,If you want the best Oolong tea that comes in a bottle buy this!!<br /><br />Once you have drank this tea you will know what real quality is.<br /><br />Great taste and flavor.  This is what teas are all about.<br /><br />BUY THIS TEA.
5,"Healthy, tasty, heck you can tell with every crunch","I'm always on the lookout for a good, natrual chip to snack on. Not that I don't love Doritos or cheese curls, but those chemically-boosted flavors tend to overwhelm my palette. Lately I've been investigating the world of natural ""junk food"". My only nod to the mainstream manufacturers is to stock the Frito Lay corn chips (fritos). They're corn, oil, and salt. And they're tasty.<br />But I digress...<br />Lundberg's Nacho Cheese chips are fantastic, certainly keeping my palette interested when I'm in a training routing and have to cut out most complex carbohydrates."
1,Old and Stale,My husband loves these candies and they are getting harder and harder to find.  I was terribly disappointed that this - as well as the scented gum that I ordered- was horribly stale.  They were just plain old.  I expected a lot more from Amazon and would be hesitant to order any perishable products through Amazon again in the future.
4,My Dog loves these Treats,My Dog absolutely loves these treats. All I have to do is say their name and I have his full and undivided attention. Good value for the price as well
3,Filling but doesn't taste very good,"I picked up a four pack of these at a local grocery store.  I did not care for the taste at all.  If you like soy, great, but I really don't like it and soy is definitely the predominant flavor.  The aftertaste is also really lingering.  I know some say that's the stevia, but I don't mind the stevia aftertaste in non-soy products, I think the combination of the two is what makes it so unpleasant for me.  I still wanted chocolate after having this, perhaps because it doesn't taste like chocolate, it tastes like soy with some cocoa.  It is filling, and I was able to use it successfully as a meal replacement (unlike your typical meal replacement drinks, which are a joke).  I also tended to get a headache and minor stomach ache while drinking it and had to practically force myself to finish each bottle.  Other drinks out there taste a LOT better, but nothing has worked as well for an easy meal that I can grab and go.  I think I will keep looking until I find the perfect protein drink for me.  I just don't think this is it.  I give it three stars because the ingredients are better than average and it does fill me up well.  It does what it should, just not in an appealing way."
3,Love Amazon's subscription process,"This is an o.k. product for wet food for my Chihuahuas & I love the size & price.  The subscription process gives me a lower price & I don't worry about running out.  My dogs are now on a really good dry food for small dogs but the almost 2 years I used this wet one, I was happy."
5,best to digest,"If you are concerned about digesting dairy and soy products you can rest assured that this is the protein for you. It's a nice vanilla flavor with no chalkiness and no artificial sweeteners. I love it and I know my body loves it. NO digestion problems, ever. Rock on."
5,New favorite product!!,"I bought this stuff with really low expectations, but I had been desperately searching for a new peanut butter substitute for a long time, and I was desperate. The first time I tried PB2, I knew I was hooked. I can't go a day without eating something I made with PB2. I would recommend trying it at least once. It's not for everyone, but you won't know if it's something you'll like until you try it! I prefer the original to the cocoa version for most purposes, but the cocoa version has its uses as well."
5,A SWEET TOOTH CANNOT BE IGNORED,"To our taste these chocolates are on a par with far more expensive ones in glittery gift boxes.<p>  We often take them as hostess gifts (hoping, of course, that said hostess will immediately open them and pass them around.)<p>  See's Candies hasn't disappointed us yet."
5,Excellent  marzipan!,Received the marzipan variety box promptly and in perfect condition. Candy was fresh and I hope I can make it last more than a few days.
5,kids love them!,They are better than any other chocolate graham we have purchased so far.  Super chocolatey and not fake tasting at all.  My kids LOVED them!
5,Tasty!,"I don't usually like protein drinks<br /><br />I DO love coffee and was looking for a good iced coffee mix<br /><br />This fits the bill perfectly - plus it's good for me :)<br /><br />I find the vanilla flavor very nice, the texture not very chalky, and the amount in the canister perfect!<br /><br />I mix with milk - never tried water - it might not be as tasty that way..."
2,Taste great but made my stomach hurt,"First of all I want to start by saying that the Vanilla Blueberry flavor is very good! I love that it has the omega's, fiber, and protein and can be eaten as a snack without milk and makes for a great healthy meal with milk. I really did love the flavor and tried the product several times but I did have stomache pains afterwards every time I ate it no matter how much or little I had. Maybe there is something in it that only my body can not tolerate. Such a shame too since I love granola of any kind and this one in particular seems very healhy for you. Wish I could keep eating it."
1,Mainly Rice and Corn  -- disappointed,"The product is mainly rice, and not very well milled rice at that.  Second Ingredient is corn, I found whole corn kernels in the bag.<br /><br />It does have rye etc. but the rice is overpowering, and considering that you can get 20lbs of rice for $7-8 at an asian market, this product seems overpriced.<br /><br />I thought this was going to be comparable to the traditional muslix type breakfast cereals (oats, rye, barley, wheat) but it is corn,rice, barley, millet etc and tastes pretty bad -- If you want the experience of this cereal, overcook some rice, and throw some oatmeal + bird seed into it...<br /><br />I tried to eat this for 4 days,  decided well if its not that healthy, and taste bad, why am I even bothering.  the birds in the back yard can enjoy it, because i didn't."
4,what happened???,"The product is great, but down to 3 boxes and 1 is totally empty---never been opened, so a little strange."
5,Spices at a fair price,"Had purchased from Butcher and Packer some years ago, and most recently became pleased to re-order a variety of different spices from themselves.<br />Package arrived very prompt, shipped very good condition,and each pound of spice packaged very professionally separated from the next.<br />Logically, Butcher and Packer are among the best assets for Amazon and its customers.<br />Shall order far more frequently than in the past,cause their level of quality has never decreased.<br />Anyone wanting to buy spices, i commend this vendor affiliated with Amazon.Keep up the good work.<br />Will submit same exact review for all items of order cause am not intending to review each one separately."
5,The Best Flavor from any Grape Drink Mix!!!,"If you are reading this, then you are wondering about the taste... there are many types of sugar-free drink mixes, and this is by far the best. Avoid the store-brand, which tend to be flavorless, and also the Crystal Light brand (a bit better, but also bland). This Ocean Spray has the best flavor of any of those. It tastes sweet but is not very tart. The grape flavor is aromatic. This typically is more expensive than the alternatives, but once you've tasted it, you won't be going back to the others."
4,take a break take a Kit Kat,"It was a nice package very awesome collection (regular,dark and white)<br /><br />But my little concert about the very mini mini size"
5,Starbucks has done it again!,"Yep, They've done it again.  Known for it's consistency, quality and boldness Starbucks company keeps pleasing me (and my taste buds) with every coffee variety.  Although I was a bit reluctant to try this ""Flavored"" coffee, it is done really well.  I was expecting sweet, but it is just coffee, bold, delightful coffee, infused with vanilla.  It produces a wonderful aroma when you wake up or works well when mixed with a liqueur for a dessert cocktail."
5,Best. Mustard. Ever.,"Great with bratwurst, breakfast sausages, salami, cheddar cheese, sandwiches, etc., even though it is a bit exotic/expensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background, it's best to keep it simple and let it stand out."
5,Gave this to my grandparents and they asked for more,"I have a hard time finding gifts for relatives, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was a hit with my grandparents.<br /><br />Every time they pop it on a day I call, they say ""we had your popcorn!"" My grandparents rarely mention any expensive gifts I give them, and they don't need anything at all.<br /><br />This is the perfect gift, because they use it as a special treat and like it.<br /><br />You can't ask more from a product than that."
5,YUM!,My 2 and 4 year old love this! Great snack food and healthy -easy to travel with any where - highly rec. though does stain if it gets on clothes.
1,Poor quality saffron,"I normally do not write reviews, but I decided to write one in this case to help fellow buyers. We recently bought 2 tins (1-ounce) of this item and I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the saffron. Despite its steep price, it is not pure saffron. We are seeing instant loss of color when dipped in water. The threads are breaking down almost instantly in water. Also, the taste and aroma are not very rich. I am quite disappointed with quality of the product and will never buy from this seller again."
5,Easy as can be!,"As a person newly diagnosed with Celiac Disease, I was devastated when I saw all the things I could no longer enjoy.  This cake mix is one of the few that leaves me feeling like I am not missing out!  I baked it for a party and NO ONE knew the difference!  It maintains the moist, spongy texture of a wheat-based cake without the wheat/gluten.  I have yet to mess up a batch, either.  It's simple, quick, and delicious!  I am hooked!"
5,Best Coffee in the world.,"The Woodstock Farmers Market used to carry this coffee.  It is the best I have ever had and I am a very picky Coffee Connoisseur.  I am so glad to find it available at Amazon.  I do prefer to shop locally but this coffee is that good, I will order on line!"
5,Perfect for removing rust,It did a great job removing rust from and old Bike frame.<br />Yes Ctric acid is great for that !!
5,Hemp Protein Powder,"After Consumner Reports came out with their results after testing protein powders, i.e. containing heavy metals, I started my search on the internet for something that did not contain these metals.  I started researching organic products and decided on the chocolate hemp protein. I also like the fact that it is made with Certified Fair Trade Chocolate.I have started on my second container.  I feel different than before I started, i.e. more energy...just feel better overall. I have a shake in the morning. I use 8 oz lowfat milk, protein powder (2 tablespoons), 1 tablespoon ground flax seed, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder, fruit of choice and some crushed ice. I have this every morning and on the weekend when I cook a regular breakfast, I do not feel as good. The chocolate taste a little different that regular chocolate, but that can be changed with a little Splenda. I am definitely buying this again."
5,truffle oil,Nothing like this oil in mac and cheese or on eggs. A very good value compared to other truffle oils in the market.
5,The BEST Tea,"I've always had to acknowledge that I can drink bad coffee but I can't drink bad tea. That means, when I go to a restaurant, I always order coffee as I can live with it if it's not great. I can't do that with tea so I only drink tea at home.<br /><br />The blend of teas that Taylors have put together for this bagged tea is phenomenal. Nothing comes close in my opinion and I drink about 5 cups of THIS tea a day. I've given up trying other blends as I'm invariably left disappointed and always end coming back to the original ""Yorkshire Tea"".<br /><br />For years I've asked my parents who still live in England (actually in Harrogate since they retired) to ship me boxes of this tea regularly as it wasn't available over here in the US (unless you wanted to pay a fortune for it). Now Amazon has made it easy for me to get the ONLY tea I enjoy drinking and at a price comparable with the junk you'll find at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Buy this tea, you won't be disappointed. Don't get the Gold blend thinking you're getting something special. It's an entirely different blend and not as good as it tastes very bitter in my opinion.<br /><br />To enjoy to the fullest, drink with milk and sugar. Oh, and buy a tea pot as the bags make up two cups."
5,Best tasting protein bars,These are the best tasting protein bars i've ever eaten. the taste sweet but only have 5 grams of sugar. they don't have that bad chemically tasting sweetness that alot of low sugar foods have.  they only have 200 calories whereas most of the protein bars i've tried have over 300 calories.  i've been trying to lose weight and starting eat one of these bars a day to try and keep myself from eating candy bars. they definitly satisfy my craving for sweets. i've lost 4 lbs in the past few weeks so at least i know they aren't preventing me from losing weight like my daily candy bar fix was.  also the carb amount is fairly low in these bars. i'm hooked on them and will plan to keep buying them in bulk.
5,delicious natural taste,it does not have any artificial taste like usual indian food packets. thats why it rocks!
4,Great taste...very poor packaging,"These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.<br />Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today."
5,Red lentils!,"Great red lentils. This is the split, lighter colored variety. You should always pick through all dry legumes before washing, but I never found a rock in these."
5,Yummy for my allergy child low sugar treat,My child loves these more than rice puffs or rice crackers. Low salt/low sugar snack. Corn/oatmeal snack.
5,Perfect Size for Little Mouths!,"I'm writing this Natural Balance dog food review for my Mom because she raves about Ultra small breed bites and wanted to share her opinion.  Her little Yorkie Patches wouldn't eat any other small bites natural food except this one.  The ingredients are great, chicken is the first on the list, and it is a very affordable and healthy dog food.  My whole family buys this brand and has for years, we love their dog and cat foods!"
2,Too much fish/chicken meals for the price,I sure wish I had researched the ingredients first. There is a large amount of fish meal and chicken meal in this supposedly high quality food. I expect to see non-meal meat by products when paying this price.
5,salmon,"A full, nutircious tastey tin of wild caight salmon. It is a full can, with firm and flavorfull meat. I would recommend it for novices in regards to wild caught salmon as well as for veteran wild-caught salmon eaters."
5,Love it!,I've become addicted to this tea. I drink at least 3 cups a day. Nice light flavor with a hint of jasmine. Smells good and tastes better.
5,Are you missing out?,"If you are not using this coffee, you are not drinking coffee!<br />Switched to Dolce Gusto a couple of years ago and love it, love it, love it.<br />I have had other one cupers but this has exceptional taste.  Love the reward<br />points that come along with the product."
1,This Rabbit is evil.,"God knows why but my daughter Shirley ordered one of these rabbits without my permission. Before the rabbit arrived my Shirley was a healthy seven year old content with playing with her dolls and stuffed animals but then the rabbit arrived and well I must say it has changed her. When she took it out of the box I was quite shocked I told her if she wanted a living pet I could get her one from the local pet store, what said she next was rather chilling she told me she knew it was dead when she ordered it. Well my husband Bruce and I have pleaded with her to throw the rabbit away but she just refuses. She has grown so attached to the now rotting carcass that she even takes it with her to school. I know this is crazy but this rabbit is pure evil and is somehow controlling my daughter. Today I went into her room to tell her dinner was ready and found her chanting in some foreign tongue in front of the rabbit which she had place on a table and surrounded with candles. I am at a complete loss. What can I possible do to save Shirley's soul? I urge people not to purchase these rabbits and if you do be it on your own he"
1,NOoodle product,"Tried this product a few different ways.  Just does not work for us.  The taste and odor are always there and the texture is unappealing - like chewing a wet, oily rubberband.  Sorry, we will not purchase this again."
4,as advertised,"Quick and easy, a hurry up solution to what to have for dinner. Kept my chops moist, provided good flavor. Good job."
5,We travel for Ooma Tesoro's,"Not all marinara sauces are created equal, and Ooma Tesoro's is the perfect example of this.  We first discovered it in a small beachside cafe, and ever since then we search it out whenever we are in the area.  The last time we discovered it at a farmer's market we bought a whole case.  Now that Amazon carries it we will never run out!"
5,very good buy,Bob's Red Mill Rice Wild/Brown Mix is a great buy and it cooks up better than any I have purchased fron the store.
3,Very strong...,"This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices."
5,Super good gum,"This is a great way to buy gum, doing away with the paper wrappers.  Also, it is tasty and sweet with no artificial taste to it.  I only use xylitol as a sweetener because it tastes clean and sweet and it is easier to metabolize."
4,good,"This is a good product to heat up as a simple side dish for lazy nights. It is a little garlicky but I like garlic so the flavor does not bother me. It isn't overpowering, I just didn't expect to taste garlic so I was kind of surprised. (I didn't read the ingredients) This is a great product, either way."
1,Absolutely disappointing,"Rather than the complex, creamy sauce you expect on Butter Chicken, this tastes more like Campbell's Tomato soup with a few spices added. Flat, artificial tasting, and not buttery at all. Totally disappointing."
5,Great taste and very filling!,I have really enjoyed the Cherry Bar by Larabar. There is NO added sugar at all - just dried fruit and almonds. I highly recommend it and plan on buying some more.
5,Tea I can't mess up,Since our mornings are very busy it is not unusually for me to leave the tea steeping too long or for me to have to reheat my cup at least twice. Somehow this tea still comes out tasting good.  It has a smokey flavor that is enhanced by just a bit of milk.  But is also very good plain or sweetened and chilled.  This is my households favorite tea.
5,SOOTHING PLEASURE!!,"THERE SHOULD BE 10 STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT!  I love it and I drink it every day.  The price was also better on Amazon.com, so I always check here first when I see something that catches my eye.  Will reorder."
1,poor design,"The lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water, the only I have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster. It's a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup! I would not buy anymore of them, unless I can fix the problem!!!!!No more disposebale K-cups for me!"
5,This is Wonderful Stuff!,"I am not generally a big fan of guacamole, and originally got this salsa for our oldest daughter, who loves the stuff. But one taste of this smooth, flavorful salsa, and I was hooked. It's on the higher end of spicy, but the heat goes away with protracted tasting. Tastes really, really good IN things, as well as on them."
5,Love This Stuff!,"I was so happy to find the Sugar-Free Jell-O cook & serve vanilla pudding here at Amazon.  My local grocery stores no longer carry it.  Being diabetic, it really comes in handy for a lot of my sugar free recipes.  I don't know what I'd do without it."
2,Stick to better brands,"I think Amazon is on the right track by offering groceries, but I think you need to stick to major brands and work a bit more on making your pricing competitive ( it was still quite a bit more than Safeway, not to mention Wal-Mart).I expect to pay a little for the convenience but not quite as much as I did. The rice crispies were a little ""different"" than I expected.I don't quite understand why you make us buy quantity when your packaging is not pre packaged? I expected to get four boxes somehow stuck together or banded together to ease your shipping costs and was quite surprised to get cereal one or two boxes of cereal to a shipping box.If that is how you are going to ship it wouldn't it be better to let us buy smaller quantities to increase your overall sales?"
5,Not a Bad Fat Anymore,"Excellent product!! I have found that coconut oil can be used in any way you would use oil or butter. It has a very mild coconut flavor----nothing that would really alter the taste of what you're preparing. It can take high heat cooking without breaking down. (All the benefits of olive oil are destroyed with high heat). It doesn't need refrigeration----another plus. Tastes great on toast. Too bad the good things about coconut oil have been surpressed for so many years. It seems to be one of the healthy fats instead of all the synthetics (e.g. margarine) and hydrogenated products on the market.<br />Must be organic, unprocessed, & cold pressed to have all the good benefits."
5,Nestle's Hot Chocolate Disappeared!,I had been purchasing these large cans of Nestle's Hot Chocolate all through last winter and even the summer months at my local grocery store. In the fall they stopped carrying the item.  I checked at several grocery stores with the same results.  I was surprised to see Amazon had the item. I placed my order and it arrived within the week. Very satisfied with the item and the service I received.
4,Great way to test new flavors!,"I love finding new K-Cups, but I don't always love spending a ton of money on cups that I hate. So the samplers are perfect! I love coffee and I love chocolate, so this is perfect. Came with a great variety of flavors. The few I've tried so far are really good. My only beef is with the packaging - I wish they'd put them in a smaller box."
5,The best there is!,"This is a staple in our family, especially around Thanksgiving. It is perfect with the turkey and the days after sandwiches.<br /><br />It is good on anything that needs some zing."
5,Good and Hot!,"If you are looking for this you probably already know what you want - HOT HOT HOT~!  This will definitely fit the bill.  I put heat on EVERYTHING and I was looking for a good HOT substitute to crushed red pepper, and weak green chilis for my pizza and, well, just about everything else.  What I ended up finding was a glorious source for the HEAT that I love.  I have been mixing this with everything!  Chicken, eggs, pizza (of course), pasta, etc. - even adding it to green chili to kick it up a few ~10,000 scovilles!  ;-)  a few months later - time for another order!<br /><br />If you like hot (you must if you're reading this) - then you cant go wrong here - This is pure concentrated hellfire heat in a jumbo sized spice container - its GREAT!<br /><br />If you are asking yourself if this might be too hot, then it probably is....."
5,My boys' love this bread,My children have been on a gluten free diet for 6 years now. They love this bread! It is great for lunches - we put it in a sandwhich holder so the bread doesn't crumble. Highly recommend it to anyone on a gluten free diet.
5,Best Cat food EVER!!!,"This stuff is great. The cats love it ( all flavors actually), and since eating it their coats are softer, shinier, with less dandruff."
5,"perfect delivery and great product, a keeper!",We are on a diet and decided to try this herb coffee and I must say it is worth every drop of goodness.
1,Yuck,These bars look and taste like they fell out of a monkey's butt.  Perhaps it's an acquired taste that I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate.  OR....the monkey thing.
5,Chips 4 R Salsa Gift Baskets,"We're a upcoming Authentic Mexican Style Salsa Company formerly from Tucson, Arizona, now located in Bend, Oregon. We wanted to make gift baskets for our customers and needed products to fill them. The Garden of Eatin' Blue Tortilla Chips fit the theme and hit the mark. We will continue with this product for any additional Gift Baskets we'll need as our business grows. SouthwestSalsaCo.com"
4,Great coffee,Great coffee.  The swiss water method is the way to go and is much easier on your body.  I like to add a teaspoon of sugar in the ground coffee before I brew it (cuts the acidity).  Mmmh.
5,Love this stuff,"I was unable to purchase this product for a long time as no stores in my area carried it, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It really does make a difference in the flavor of foods. The size of the canister is a bit unwieldy and the holes rather too large so the stuff pours out too quickly-I had to buy herb shaker to cut the weight and dispensing hole s down to a comfortable size."
5,Great food.,"I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select."
5,Excellent Treat,These are excellent and healthy training high value treats.  My dogs love them.  They are good to handle after hydrating.  I like they come in various versions.
1,Save your money,"I was really hoping that this would be decent, after reading the reviews.  It was not.  I will give my remaining bags of coffee away to someone who does not care.  It just lacked ...... flavor."
3,Cereal Boxes Are Fragile,"Grape Nuts Flakes is Grape Nut Flakes.  It's not like I didn't know what the product was when I ordered it.  We were having difficulty finding the product on our local grocery store shelves.  Price was good when coupled with others s for free shipping.  Delivery was prompt.  Could have been better packaged in the shipping carton.  The end boxes of the 4 pack were pretty beat up.  The product was OK, but the boxes wouldn't stand up when seperated."
5,Perfect!!,I have a chihuahua and he LOVES IT!!! Its a great food for small dogs!!!! My dog is very happy with this food!!
5,Delish!,"These bars are amazing ... and at a terrific price!  For anyone who likes to carry a snack with them, I'd highly recommend KIND bars.  All of the flavors are really great!"
5,Great Snack!,"These were great! These cookies were soft and very tasty, almost like fresh baked.  They were much larger than I expected. Great product, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Tasty enough, just hard to chew","The granola was alright and tasted good.  My issue with it was that it was very hard to chew.  I couldn't eat much before my jaw was exhausted.  It was so terrible because I was so excited about cinnamon, almond, cocoa granola - I found it addictive but it wore out my face!"
5,Outstanding!!!,I'm fairly new to the gluten-free lifestyle and I've only tried a few brands of bread.  Udi's takes the cake!!!  It toasts really well and makes a wonderful sandwich bread.
2,"Good Taste, Bad Chunks","As soon as I received my bottle of Chantea I put it in the fridge so I could give it a try.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty neat, a fun shaped bottle with a bright label, the taste is very good...but please, remove the chunks of fruit!  Maybe some people enjoy drinking not so smooth items, but to me, the fruit pieces was a real turn off...I could get descriptive of my thoughts while drinking it, but I'll spare you the details.<br /><br />I really did love the taste, and I would buy this product if it were liquid only, but until then I'll steer clear from this product."
1,Threw them out,"This is an easy review because the judgement was made by our two papillons. They live for their treats and are NOT especially picky about treats. These items are dried, uniform in size, and although they may be ""organic"" they smell bad and my dogs would have nothing to do with them. I threw them out and wanted to share the expensive experience with others so they would not waste their money."
5,One taste and you are converted!,This is the best coffee flavor I have tried in a long time.  I have not always been a coffee fan - but this has an amazing buttery sweet taste!
5,Cereal Lover,"This cereal is awesome.  Taste Great and healthy for you, along with being a great source of fiber.  The price on Amazon.com also beats what it costs in a local grocery store."
1,WARNING - Contains DRM!,"The manufacturer of this innocuous looking animal has seen fit to hide a rather disgusting form of DRM in it without disclosing this fact to us paying customers.  I purchased this rabbit for my daughter, as I thought it would be nice for her to have a more realistic toy than her current stuffed teddy bears and dolls.  To my astonishment, it began to smell very bad after only a few hours, and eventually degraded into a hard, wrinkly lump of brittle rabbit flesh.  Totally unsuitable for cuddling.  It is obvious that the manufacturer expects you to then buy another to replace it.  Well not this guy!  Once I have been burned I do not return to the flame for more.  I will not be purchasing another Cloverdale whole animal, and I suggest that none of you do either.  If we continue to accept these practices, things will only become worse!  What's next, Cloverdale?  Bears with claws?<br /><br />*EDIT*  It has come to my attention that this animal is intended to be either frozen or consumed immediately at time of receipt.  I believe Amazon should be more thorough in their descriptions of products such as this!  I do not think it is unreasonable to assume that people will be buying this animal for reasons other than consumption.  Until Amazon changes their description, I will stand by my 1 star rating!"
5,beyond wonderful,These people make very incredibly yummy stuff. This is the second of their jams<br />that I have tried and I loved it as much as the first - which was the fig.<br />One jar arrived broken but I didn't mind!
5,Banana Nut Bread,"I received a free sample of this bar from Influenster.com.  I really enjoyed this bar.  It's a great alternative to eating candy bars or unhealthy sweets.  If you are working and need a mid-day snack, these are great.  I can also see how they'd be a great bar to eat in the mornings if you are running late but want to make sure you don't skip breakfast.  You can eat it on the go. It tastes great and it's a better snack to eat than most items you'll find in a vending machine. I will be buying a box of these in the future."
5,Eight O'Clock Coffee Rocks,Good quality coffee at a good price. I have been buying Eight O'Clock Coffee from my local grocery store for years - 100% Arabica beans (depending on the variety you select) - you cant go wrong. I like the original and Columbian.
5,Awesome brew!,Tully's Italian Roast has thus far been my favorite to brew with the Keurig coffeemaker. I decent medium-bold blend. Coffee arrived super quick and in good condition.
5,Excellent AND healthy treat!,"I love the Plato line of products as they allow me to just mindlessly pick from the line and know that I am feeding something good to my dog(s). As for ""Smart Dog Snacks"" with Ginkgo Biloba and DHA...I'd better watch out, because my dogs love these treats so much that the treats just may make them smart enough to figure out how to open the ""treat cabinet"" take the container down and unscrew the lid to help themselves!<br /><br />While the treats themselves look like beef jerky, they are made with all natural, organic ingredients. The dogs don't care what's in these treats, they just know they love them. As I am typing this they are both sitting at attention, staring at me and whimpering while trying to do the Jedi Mind Trick of ""you want to give us more Smart Dog Snacks, pick up your hand from that keyboard and reach in the container and hand us more. Do it. Do it now.""<br /><br />There's so much junk out there and plenty of junk food that claims to be natural (just like people food) but this stuff is the real deal. Much like the food that I feed to the humans in the family, I know what each of the ingredients are and love that the first two ingredients are duck and brown rice. There aren't cost cutting fillers in these treats; it's a straight up high quality product. As an aside, I've bought from the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet many times, and I am always impressed with the products they carry. Just as I know that I can trust the Plato brand, I know that if a product is being carried by The Whole Healthy Pet, then it is a high quality product and I feel like a good parent getting it for my dogs."
2,blegh,"when i ordered this product, i remember that it had 4.5 stars.<br /><br />To my disappointment, the stew isn't tasty. it's not awful, is the best description for it. The meat is cheap, ground meat high in fat.<br /><br />The only good thing about is that it fills you up."
1,Potentially Poisonous - DO NOT BUY,"Like the other reviewers, I agree that dog treats made in china are potentially poisonous, and should be avoided at all costs.  My dog is too precious to me to even take the risk.  Chinese people eat dogs, they don't care about yours.  I urge all consumers to send emails to Waggin Train AND Milos Kitchen and let them know these products are NOT ACCEPTABLE to Americans.  There's no reason why hard-working Americans can't make tasty dog treats, and we would make them with love instead of poison.  I WOULD pay a little more if these treats were American.  Rachael Ray has a terrific line of dog treats, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Y7TRJ2"">Rachael Ray Dog Treats Nutrish Soup Bones Long Lasting Chews - Real Chicken and Veggies Flavor</a> which are made in USA and my lil Daisy LOVES them!"
5,Delicious decadence!!,"These are great!  And they can get to be habit forming if you are not careful.  I bought the whole case, because you save overall  versus going to the supermarket.  Very rich dark chocolate, crisp cookie.  Worth every penny.  Oreo, eat your heart out!"
5,Awesome Rub!!!!,This rub is great stuff.  I have had several dishes that will absolutely become part of my weekly diet.  This rub completely enhances any type of potato sprinkle it on sweet potato fries or cubed new potatoes.  It adds tremendous flavor to chicken and ribs great for a variety of things.  MKS
1,Confusing and expensive,"I just got the Honeydew powder I ordered. It was shipped very quickly which was great. I am a bit confused though. When reading through the listing it said to mix the product with 1 scoop sugar or simple syrup, 1 scoop powdered creamer and 1 scoop of honeydew powder. This made sense till I read the ingredient label on the product. It lists sugar and non dairy creamer as the first ingredients. I was under the impression that the order was for flavored powder and that I would be adding my own sweetener and creamer powder. I am diabetic so I am unable to use this with sugar in it. Both the product description and the directions for preparation are extremely sketchy. If I were to take the product I was sent and prepare it with the directions I was given it would be nothing but sugar and creamer. I paid well over $40 with the high shipping cost for a 2.3 lb. bag of sugar and creamer that I could have purchased at the grocery store for about $3. That is robbery."
5,Great taste and easy to use!,I had tried to use grocery store oil and popcorn in my countertop popper but it always tasted stale and not a bit like movie theater popcorn.  Decided to try this for a party and it made a world of difference.  Tasted just like fresh popped corn at the theater.  The packs were easy to use.  Just cut across the top and dump all 3 packets into the heated popper.  I will definitely buy again.
5,free at last!,This product has helped me break free from the peanut butter habit!!!  It tastes so good!!!  Thank you PB2!  I put it on yogurt and add it to my oatmeal.  It keeps me totally satisfied for hours.  I just ordered my second package with chocolate and regular.  It's a great way to get protein.  Wonderful product!!!
5,Awesome buy!,Not only do I purchase other quality products from Navitas...this is an amazing buy at 50 sheet count!!! They don't even sell this quanty at my local market...awesome deal here! Plus the product and company make high quality products
5,chocolate heaven,"I'm a Brit living in the US. These are my favorite ever chocolate bars from the homeland. This price is GREAT! In World Market, the only other place I've found that stocks them, they are $1.99 per flake. So this is a brilliant deal. Only problem is, having 24 in the house at one time is ever so tempting......"
5,Delicious Herbal Tea!,Love this herbal tea! It's so delicious! It tastes just like Oolong Tea from the chinese restaurant minus the unhealthy tannins found in actual tea!
5,Easy Now tea is great!,"I put 1-2 teabags of Easy Now in an entire teapot let it steep for 20-30 min and have some before bed. No matter when I got to sleep, I always wake up 7-8 hours later, feeling good, and without having woken up in the middle of the night. (except maybe to use the restroom, but I always fall back asleep instantly) Its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves, it won't make you sleepy. This is easily my favorite calming tea."
4,Best Quinoa,"I only gave this product 4 stars because it's so expensive, but we do love it.  I first bought this brand, and through Amazon, because no matter how much I washed bulk quinoa I bought, it would always have a stone in it.  I've been getting this quinoa for 3 years now and it's wonderful.  I wish it were less expensive, but I won't stop buying it."
5,a great cookie!,"Love these and am glad to be able to get them here.  If you're looking for a rich chocolate cookie, Tim Tams are it.  Not sure which American cookie to compare them to, probably a chocolate covered Oreo, but with a chocolate middle.  Lots of chocolate here.  That's actually a downside for me.  Too much chocolate.  A little goes a long way with me, so these are amazing in moderation and with a big glass of milk."
3,What I didn't know before buying Mexican Coke  on Amazon,"I love Coca-Cola & have for decades. Mexican Coke is it for me. I live in Chicago and can find bottles sold in stores. But I wanted to get cases which I only found at warehouse stores some times. So I purchased Mexican Coke on Amazon. The Coke came in a large box. Each bottle was individually wrapped in bubble wrap. Over that, the bottles were individually wrapped in brown paper. I don't know if the cost of 24 pack Mexican Coca-Cola is expensive because of the wrapping product, the labor cost, both, or neither. I suspected both the wrapping and labor cost drove the price up. Now that I saw how the Coke got delivered, I will avoid buying it online again but I am enjoying it."
5,Chai latte fan,"I have been enjoying chai for several years, but have only recently found this variety.  It has become my favorite for making my morning chai latte and as long as it is available,,,,, not switching."
5,New Fan,"I can't believe some people actually manage to compare these bars to Snickers or other fake-ingredient bars. Really? A 200 calories of fruit and nuts vs. hydrogenated, high-fructose, heart-attack calling candy bars should really make this decision easy.<br />I actually came across Larabars just recently. I heard about them, but I was just never too curious to actually read the ingredients and try one. To give a little background on my life-style, I do all of my own cooking to make sure I know exactly what goes into it. I stray away from all the processed foods and I don't eat grains and starches such as potatoes. I also don't eat refined sugars as it falls into a category of processed foods. With that said, I am a human being and I do get cravings for something dessert-like. I have very high standards for my dessert. It has to be all-natural, unprocessed, and preferably without added sweeteners. With all of those requirements one has to pretty much always prepare their desserts from scratch because there aren't whole lot of prepackaged foods out there that have that same philosophy about preparing it. Larabar is one of the very few out there who actually got it right.<br />I was a little skeptical about the taste of the bars when I bought a couple to sample, but they all exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be buying them in the future.<br />Now, I wouldn't overindulge in eating a few of those a day as they are still plenty sweet and carbolicious, but I usually have a few bites after lunch as a dessert treat. One bar lasts me 3-4 days and I will choose it over Snickers any time of the day."
5,Tastes great,"My 12 year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning. The cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice. We add a splash of milk to cool it off and it's so good. I don't taste anything artificial, in fact the quality is great. We will bring this camping for the younger kids. With the powders we always had clumps, this brews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff!"
3,VERY Lemon,"A very natural, crisp drink, but it is LEMONY like I've never tasted before.  Gave me some wicked heartburn, but then again, that's just the way I reacted to it.  If you're into a lightly carbonated Lemon drink made with the well known and trusted San P. water, this stuff is for you.  If you tend to get heartburn/reflux, I'd advise you to steer clear."
5,Both My Husband and Me Like This,"It is so easy and nothing to add except water.<br /><br />I like it with more water than my husband.<br /><br />Yum!<br /><br />Great for late late night too...you know, instead of eggs!"
2,"Weak coffee, unpleasant aftertaste","The Good: The Marley Coffee One Love coffee pods are simple to use and even simpler to clean up.  Just remove the pod from the basket and throw away.  At $10 a box, the price per cup is not bad, either.<br /><br />The Bad:  The coffee is weak tasting.  I tried several pods with differing amounts of water and the coffee still tasted weak.  My pods were ""Exotic Floral and Berry"" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee."
5,Strongest black tea,Awake. The name says it all. This is the strongest bagged black tea I know of. Not for those who like a milder black tea.
4,"Sweet and tasty, but not a huge hit in my house","The main juice drinkers in my house, the kids and my husband, did not like this so much.  It's a little thick, which the kids were not thrilled with.  It has a great flavor and nicely sweet.  I think if you can get over the way it looks, it's pretty good.  Certainly full of good stuff."
5,great snack,These bars are really good. They are chewy and crunchy with a fruity flavor. At 100 calories each they make a perfect snack and are easily kept in your purse or even pocket. Love them.
4,My dog loves these,My dog is only 2 but has a bad front leg. I wanted to give her a treat that she will love but will also help her leg for years to come. This seems like it's the one! She absolutely loves these treats and I feel good giving them to her. I have not met a dog yet that doesn't like the taste. The 6-pack is the way to go - SO MUCH CHEAPER than buying them in the store. Bone appetite!
5,"Great, fun baby food!","My son loves these, they are not filling but great to entertain him while we're preparing his actual meal.  Highly recommend!"
5,Hawwian Ice Flavors,I had recently bought an Hawaiian Ice Machine from Great Northern which we love.  The kids loved the flavors and the added cones and straws are an added bonus.  A little pricey but delivered to your door and ready to go.
3,it was good.,"The tea was fine ground, not full leaf with hibiscus and raspberry pieces.  I was disappointed because that is when you get the best flavor.  Otherwise it was okay."
3,"Newman's Own Organics Prunes, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",Not bad.<br />Have had better...<br />I did find these to be moist enough to rate it 3 stars...<br />Moistness in packaged prunes is a priority to me.<br />Nice an sweet. About average size whole dried plums.<br />Must refrigerate after opening which it tells you on the package.<br />I think I got a fair price for what I got.
5,I am also order more decaf,This pod make a really nice cup of coffee and it a FULL 8 ounce size not that wimpy half cup that we suffered through with Senseo - you should consider that when costing out the purchase.  We tried the regular and supreme blends and like them ALL>
2,not real sesame paste,"When I read the ingredients on the jar I was disappointed because it's supposed to be just sesame paste but it's not. The ingredients are sesame and peanut. Peanut is used in some Chinese dishes if sesame paste is not available but it isn't as good as sesame. There's also no way to know how much is sesame and how much is peanut. At $11 a jar there's no excuse for the peanut. Also there is another source for this product @ $5.99, a saving of $5."
5,Tasty and convenient,"This drink has some zip to it.  It's really tasty and I'm happy it dissolves easily, has vitamins, zero calories, is sugar free and is so convenient.  I keep these on hand at work to spruce up a plain bottle of water when I want some flavor.  These stix are really convenient to travel with too.  I can get a bottle of water anywhere and add the tea for a kick."
2,Weird taste,"Definitely not my favorite.  I love KIND bars, but this variety has a strange after taste.  Would not recommend."
4,N-E-S-T-L-E-S,"Do you remember the old nestle jingle? n-e-s-t-l-e-s nestles' makes the very best......<br /><br />Well it's still true!  The best hot chocolate powder.<br /><br />Good buy, but it is odd the larger container costs more per once than this one.<br /><br />As always Amazon delivers."
5,Much better and less expensive than that ordered from Keurig!,"I recently purchased a Keurig and I bought the Cafe Escapes dark chocolate cocoa from their site, and it was not chocolately and had a strange aftertaste.  I saw the Grove Square brand and thought I would give it a try since I got 36 kcups for less than the 24 from Keurig. I received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it.  The cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the Cafe Escapes. I will be ordering this one again, and I hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it!"
2,Not so Hot,"I enjoy this brand of cookies, but this flavor just isn't very good.  It tastes a bit like stale coffee."
5,Love It - better than described,Cotton candy sugar packs were better than described and a great value.<br />They make perfect cotton candy and the containers hold much more product than I thought they would.<br />You only need a small amount to make the cotton candy and it is delicious!!!!!!!!<br />My daughter really wanted a cotton candy maker and I was a little hesitant but am extremely happy to have purchased these sugar flavor packs that work so well.<br />Would definitely recommend.
5,Favorite Superfood Drink - love Chia seeds,"This is my favorite flavor. I drink it in the morning and usually after a workout. great for hydration, love the seeds, makes me feel full, leaves me feeling more energized, and it is Fun to drink. The taste is great, i love that it is only 40 calories and low in sugar. If I am hungry it gives me a feeling of being full until I have time to get something to eat. Omega 3 is important to me to combat inflammation, so this is a great source for me. Also, there are other great benefits to this drink, high fiber content, antioxidants...i recommended it to anyone looking for a healthy tasty alternative to what is market."
1,disposa kups ordered from Amazon,I ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups. They don't fit together without a big production. The lids won't fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup. Just a big mess. not what I wanted at all. want to return them and get a refund. Donna Phillips
5,Dumplins,These make the best chicken and dumplings ever.  So glad I found these on Amazon. I use to have to drive 500miles to get these. Amazon is awesome
5,"great soup base, quick lunch","these are a step up from the quick noodles you find at the local (anglo) grocer.  i keep several at the office for emergency at-the-desk lunches, and gave a box to my elderly mother who uses for simple, quick meals; so far so good w/ mom :)  the included spices add heat and flavor, w/o the artificial taste that the more available brands have."
3,Wheat free product.,"Taste is good, color holds up, however, noodles fall apart easily, hard to make a pasta salad, even if slightly undercooked.  Serves its purpose for wheat free diet."
5,A wonderful product.,"This is a wonderful product.  My family loves the pancakes and the scones and they don't need the gluten free product like I do.  It is very easy to use and tastes ""normal"", unlike some gluten free products."
5,Fantastic,"This is a very soft, yet rich and subtle Pralines and Cream flavoring. I use it for baking and hot coffee drinks. I will use this product often."
4,Good snack,"In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Sesame. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, ""No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors"". 11% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost."
4,"Good value, great for your health","I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas.  I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally.  In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a positive habit.  I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects.  Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aid focus, the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right.  The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value.  I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first.  I'm on my second box of 100, and have recently discovered another listing of the same tea here that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  How many good habits are this affordable?"
4,Surprisingly wonderful,"I have to start out by saying i""m not a big fan of Fig Newtons (or any other variety of the previous Newton cookies).  However, I loved these little cookies.  I'm not a fan of the ""gooeyness"" of Fig Newtons or the stickiness of the fruit filling. These are crisp cookies with bits of fruit and a hint of a honey flavor.  They would be great with a cup of tea for an afternoon snack or a decadent breakfast.  They have some amount of fiber in them. So, you can tell yourself they're nutritious."
5,This tea has a fresh and nice look,"This tea tastes great, and it gives a nicely conceived fresh looking feel.<br /><br />I purchase 2 small packages, but I sure will get more."
5,Accidental happiness,I bought this by accident thinking it was the regular Wheatebix my husband likes. We tried it and were very surprised by it. One of the few high fiber cereals that tastes good.  I have it in my subscribe order now so we stay stocked up. Crushed it also makes a good crumb coating on chicken. Sounds odd but it's really good.
5,Yum!,I love using this in my coffee and my chocolate mint Stash tea.  Purchasing via Amazon is actually cheaper than Vitacost which is also a frugal choice and where I bought it before this option.
5,Good,"Very good product, just wish it were a bit hotter. I would purchase again though. Very fast shipping and packed well."
5,Tasty,"I was surprised at how good this tasted.  It's sweet and you can really taste the pineapple.  It also has only 10 calories per 16oz serving (better than soda) and it mixes well in water.  The tea also doesn't have that strong instant tea after taste.<br /><br />I would definately, buy this again."
5,"Super easy to use, great tasting!","this is by far the best product for a fountain! It tastes great and does not require oil, so easy to use any where. I just used it with the Wilton Chocolate Pro, outside and it worked great! Can't wait to use my fountain again! Clean immediately though - it hardens up a ton!"
5,Excellent Flavor,"Glad to see that Amazon carries Rockstar Energy Drinks. Personally, I enjoy this flavor compared to the other Rockstar and energy drinks. It has a great flavor and definitely boosts my energy! This one in particular is hard to find in stores and I am glad that this can be purchased with Free Shipping and have it delivered to my door. Try this out, you won't regret it!"
4,More butter please!,Could have been more buttery but otherwise a great popcorn for 100 calories. It seemed to be larger than other 100 calorie popcorn bags.
5,Some Tings Never Change,"TABASCO - I've grown up using it on just about anything that needed a little ""help"" in the taste department.  And also on things that didn't need any help at all.  Tabasco is either loved or reviled, but you gotta give credit where credit is due - they haven't changed the recipe in forever!!"
4,MBT Chicken Broth Packets,I am finding out that this product is no longer available.  The one and only box I found on line cost almost twice as much as what I paid for it.  It is/was a good product for flavoring foods and convenient for a quick pick-me-up cup of soup......but I don't think it's worth paying double the price to purchase it now.  I am sure there are other products on the market that will do the same.
1,Product can cause serious dental problems,"I like Kashi products overalls and loved this cereal at first. However, the consistensy is too hard. It caused, not one, but TWO major dental problems for me (a young woman in her thirties). One morning, I broke a filling eating my morning breakfast. Dismissing the problem, I then later broke a cap snacking on the cereal. Overall, my dental bill amounted to almost $2,000.<br /><br />My advice is that if you have any dental work at all, like most of us in the world, avoid this particular Kashi product unless you want a very large dental bill."
5,absolutely delicious!,"These chips are awesome! All natural (even the coloring comes from beet root and not chemicals) and all flavorful. These are the best tasting, most versatile chips I have ever tasted. They work well with salsa, cheese, dips, and even by themselves. The chips are crispy, have a great texture, and they stand up to thick dips.  Despite being jalapeno, they are not too spicy and not too bland. These are just right. Highly recommend these chips!"
5,Perfect size for our family.,"This packaging for graham crackers is wonderful for families with young kids.  There are six packages of grahams in the box, each containing about 8 half-sized crackers.  We are able to travel with these a little at a time and not worry about the whole box going stale.  They are also great for making smores, as they are already the right size.  Great idea when wanting to make smores for just a couple of people."
5,DisposaKups,I received and have been using my DisposaKups for several days.  I highly recomend this product.  I fill up a dozen or so at a time and just pop them into the Coffee maker when I want a fresh cup of coffee.  The coffee comes out fresh and with no coffee grounds in the cup.  Who could ask for more?
5,AWESOME!!!,"I bought this because my friend told me about it. I'm currently on HerbaLife (diet) and replace 2 meals with shakes. The PB2 is perfect because I can control how much is going in without the sticky mess of traditional peanut butter & can figure calories, protein, fat, etc. alot more easier! PB2 also lasts a long time but I will def order again as soon as I start running low. Awesome idea!! Also, the recipe cards are wonderful too."
1,That Company SUCKS and Hard to Deal With,"It took forever to get my cookies, and I paid for express shipping and got my product 3 weeks later, I will never order from that company again."
5,"A healthy, tasty bar",I don't care for sweet bars with lots of ingredients.  This one is a simple blend of healthy ingredients that give me an energy boost when doing something active.
5,"THE best chai...and it's instant, unsweetened & all organic!","This is hands down THE best chai - IF you like your chai spicy (and what's the point if it's not spicy?).  Bonus, it's instant!  Don't be deterred by the price of this small can - you use just 1/8 (yes, that's right...one-eighth) of a teaspoon per cup, add hot water, milk & sweetner and instantly you have a cup of hot, spicy chai goodness.  I LOVE that there is no milk or artificial milk or sweetner of any kind, so I can customize my own cup and don't have to deal with any unwanted goodies.<br /><br />The company seems really conscientious and only uses ORGANIC herbs/spices.  If you go to their website they list each spice detailing the health benefits.  When I gave up coffee I became a chai fanatic and darn near went broke drinking a local brand that comes liquid in bottles (at $10/qt!).  Plus it was sweetened, so I couldn't control the sweetness - pre-sweetened is ALWAYS too sweet for me.  I went online and ordered every unsweetened chai I could find and started brewing my own.  I kept thinking ""why doesn't someone take the liquid and dehydrate it""?  This was the only company that did and it just happened that it was the best tasting!  You can buy this in one-pound bags as well, so as soon as I'm finished with my can (which I've had for over a month now), I'll start buying in bulk to fill my cans.  The cans are the perfect size too - they fit easily in your purse for chai-on-the-go."
5,Robust Coffee,"I like strong coffee, and jet fuel is one of my favorites. The Keurig individual packages ensure that the coffee always taste fresh."
5,Flavorful,"IN each container, you can make 8 1-cup recipes for salad dressing.  The herbs are flavorful.  I used them to sprinkle on chicken with amazing results.  A great combination of flavor for homemade salad dressing without buying several herbs and spices.  I would buy again!"
1,"Terrible product! Expensive, tricked, distasteful and embarrassing","I have never written a bad review in my life, but I felt this was way beyond what i could take. I had recently moved for work and my husband wanted to send me a surprise birthday gift that I could share with my co-workers. So, he spent over $50 and ordered mini cup cakes from this site and gave them the exact address and department that it needs to be sent to. However, the package did not have department address, just the main address, so it traveled all around the company and landed on my boss's desk! She informed me and when I went to pick it up, I told her that it was cupcakes and she invited all my co-workers to share my birthday. Can you imagine the shock, when I opened the box and had to pass out 30 boxes of candy to my new co-workers instead of cup cakes? They tried to be a good sport and tasted it .... it was terrible ... it had all melted and stuck together in the heat like one big discolored, shapeless flat blob! I felt sick and was throwing up after it and so did couple of my co-workers. I was so embarrassed, I had made a fool of myself, made myself and new co-workers sick, wasted everyone's precious time and my husband spent over $50 for this!!! I spent my birthday evening alone, crying and throwing up. I feel so embarrassed interacting with any of my co-workers who had to suffer from this experience. I am very disappointed with the product and service."
1,Missing items,"I only received 19 cans when I paid for 24. Also, two cans were busted. I am $10 short from this order."
5,Great work and on the go tea,"I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey."
4,Great canned cat food.,"My 2 cats are pretty picky, but they gobbled this stuff up. Both of them have sensitive stomachs, & I haven't seen this up on my couch or carpet yet, haha. It's very easy to mash up or cut up and it's not too stinky. My cats really enjoy the taste as well! Amazon has a great price too. I believe my local Costco has it for a little bit cheaper, but other than that, this is a great canned cat food for a great price on Amazon. Oh, I didn't give it a full 5-star even though I wanted to because I did notice that there is ""so & so BY-PRODUCT"" in the ingredients. I'm not 100% comfortable giving food like that to my pets so I sadly had to dock of a star.<br /><br />A couple of interesting tips I'de like to give out about cat food is:<br /><br />- Cats are carnivores. They need actual meat. Canned cat food comes closet to that. It's been proven that feeding cats wet food will improve their overall health & personality by a great deal. I have to admit that there has been less vomiting, healthy poops, & much more fun & interactive play time with each other & myself. I give half a cup of dry food with half a can of canned food to each cat everyday. [:<br /><br />- A lot of people have misinterpreted that cats need to graze on food all day. This in fact isn't true at all. Cats are more closely related to their wild cousins; wild cats like lions, cheetahs, cougars, etc, don't eat everyday either because of an unlucky catch or other natural related things. The same theory applies to our domestic feline friends. Feeding cats once a day is plenty for them. Plus it keeps them in shape so they don't over eat!<br /><br />(I read this in an old National Geographic. I'm also a graduate biological anthropologist)."
5,Excellent Tortilla chips,"These chips are truly amazing. They have it all. They're light, crisp, great tasting, nice texture, AND they're all natural... AND low in fat and sodium! Need I say more? I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store, and couldn't belive my taste buds. That's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case!"
5,Tasty Pizza Kit!,"This pizza kit is healthy, tasty, quick, and easy. You do not often get health and convenience at the same time, but this pizza kits delivers! I highly recommend it!"
1,Nasty ... Taste like cheap prunes ...,"My wife loves apricots, fresh and dried.  For years, she has been getting me to buy dried Blenheim pitted slabs from [...] for about $[...]/pound (nearly $[...]/pound delivered).  I think that's a lot!<br /><br />I bought this thinking that, at about $[...]/pound delivered, it was a comparative steal.<br /><br />NOPE!  This stuff is dark and pruney, with a nasty, unclean aftertaste.<br /><br />I resent ApricotKing and their high prices, but at least their fruit is bright, fresh and clean tasting.  Newman's stuff is just garbage and, at $[...]/pound, doggone expensive garbage!<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that these are high grade U.S. apricots.  They remind me of those terrible Mediterranean and Turkish apricots I tried once:  Dark brown with a weird ""chewing tobacco"" aftertaste."
4,"Great, but even darker might be better for my taste","Very goo bar but a little sweet for my taste... I like my chocolate even darker. I compared it with similar bar from Trader Joe's with the same 54% cocoa, although the Trader Joe's bar is a huge one pounder. The Newman's bar was slightly smoother, perhaps just a little more waxy and sweeter. Big plus for Newman's Own is that it is organic and rainforest alliance certified.  Next, I'll need to move up to the next level of dark from Newman's Own. Maybe that will be the perfect bar for me. I know I like the Trader Joe's 70% bar better than this one but the darker version of Newman's Own might be even better."
5,Best I've ever used,I love this conditioner. Doesn't weigh my hair down or dry it out after 12 hours as some conditioners have. Its very thick and smells great yet light enough to not compete with the light perfume I wear on occasion.
5,Quite simply the best Ginger Ale I have ever had.,"I am so excited to see that Amazon carries Blenhiem. Unfortunately its not available anywhere in SW Florida and the only time I could get it was when driving up or down the east coast and happened to pass through the Carolina's. I always hit ""South of the Border"" just to pick up some Hot Ginger Ale.<br /><br />I tend to drink sugar free soda's only but for this guilty pleasure I will take the extra calories with a smile.<br /><br />They do make a diet version and while it is still quite good it doesn't even compare to the Red Cap.<br /><br />Anthony"
3,Chocolates might be great; shipping was less so; customer service is great,"While it was shipped to me insulated in styrofoam, no cold packs were included in the shipment--which was heading to Atlanta in early September (the American South in the summer).  I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact.  Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted.  I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees.<br /><br />UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem.  Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens.<br /><br />The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order.  I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction.  I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).  I am *very* pleased with this level of service."
5,Melt in your mouth explosion,These chocolates are absolutely the best.  I had a bunch of co-workers come by and have some.  I advised them to let the chocolate melt in your mouth... don't chew.  A while later many of them came back to tell me about the awesome experience they had.  Simply the best chocolate they have had.<br /><br />The secret is to let the chocolate slowly melt.... as it does you experience a sensational explosion of taste.  Wonderful treats.  And for this price it is amazing... it rivals the French chocolates at a store down the street..... at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />Enjoy...and make sure to let these delightful nuggets slowly melt in your mouth.
5,Orgain,"I just had a heart bypass and my doctor recommended a diet high in protein to help build muscle mass after the surgery.  I had never tried a supplement other than a multi-vitamin.  I try to eat organic so I was told by a nurse that there was an organic protein drink on the market.  I did some research and found that ORGAIN met my requirements.  I've been drinking it for about two months now, at least one a day.  Not only do they taste good, but they have helped me gain back a lot of the muscle mass that I lost during my hospital stay (almost two weeks).  The only draw back to the product is the cost.  Most protein supplements cost a little more than half the cost of ORGAIN, but being organic I guess justified the higher cost.  I would highly recommend this product."
5,Great,Try some of this in your sauce for lasagne.  It gives it that extra umph and makes people ask what it is that made the flavor so special.
5,Fresh & delicious!,What a surprise!  I was hesitant to order but with 2 Narnia loving kids I decided to risk it.  These arrived well packaged/sealed & were incredibly fresh.  Great flavors & generous portions of nuts.  The rose & hazelnut are superb with the rose tasting exactly like we've imagined a homegrown rose would taste if you took a bite :-)  Have already purchased this brand again here on Amazon.  Highly recommend!!!
1,Diarrhea 2 for 2,"Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online."
5,Simply the BEST!,"I have been using this product for more that 10 years.  I call it my crutch dressing.  Whenever a dish needs a boost this is the product I use. Try mixing this ingredient with additional yellow miso, sake and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil and poach halibut in the broth. Serve fish and reduced broth over rice.  Delicious!"
4,Great food. Good price.,"Dogs love the food, but gets the one pretty gassy. Maybe she needs to get used to it.<br /><br />High quality food. Good price."
3,"BROKEN COOKIES, BAD PACKAGING","These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore."""
5,Very good bars.,These are very good bars and being individually wrapped stay fresh a long time. My husband carries them in his car for a quick and easy snack.
5,When it's a macadamia...brand name matters!,"I bought the Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macs with sea salt in Hawaii. They were so darn good, I wanted more, but they were very expensive in the supermarket. So, I ordered the 6-pack through Amazon.<br /><br />Not sure why, but the estimated ship time was a few weeks off and I had a hankering for macs. So, I bought a cheaper brand at the supermarket. They were awful; absolutely no flavor. I tried again with a mid-priced brand -- same problem. These I returned to the market.<br /><br />Then, I test-tasted one at Whole Foods. Awful.<br /><br />I started to think that maybe I wasn't remembering it right. Maybe these Mauna Loa macs weren't all that good. Then, finally, they arrived. Oh, my goodness! This is what a mac is supposed to taste like! Fresh, flavorful, just the right amount of salt.<br /><br />These are absolutely the best and, to date, I have not found a substitute. Store brand peanuts...sure. Store-brand -- or any other brand -- macadamia nut? Heck no!"
5,wow!,"I love coconut water, but usually stay away from the flavored options. Tried this on a fluke, while in an airport, and thought it was delicious. It tastes very similar to a Yoohoo, if you're familiar with that drink. Not quite the ""refreshing"" taste that I think the plain coconut water has, but definitely a tasty beverage that I find enjoyable. If you like chocolate, this is a good beverage."
5,probably among the best sugar free and no sugar added biscotti and cookies,"AUNT GUSSIES SUGAR FREE AND NO SUGAR ADDED BISCOTTI AND COOKIES ARE AMONG THE BEST SOLD.ESPECIALLY OUTSTANDING ARE ITS ""NO SUGAR ADDED CRANBERRY ORANGE BISCOTTI WITH ALMONDS AND CHOCOLATE CHIP BISCOTTI AND COOKIES. WELL WORTH THE PRICE, WHICH AMAZON.COM SELLS AT A DISCOUNT.<br /><br />I PERIODICALLY PURCHASE SAME FROM AMAZON.COM"
5,Doggie Dope,My chihuahuas love their greenies.  If they don't get them by 6:30 p.m. they let me know.  It's part of their routine and they know it.
5,The Best Tea in the World,This is the real stuff! You just have not had tea until you try this tea.
4,"Good value, not oily, crisp, fresh, but dominated by the potato variety","Overall one of the better veggie stix I have tried. I liked that they have much less of an oil taste than other brands I have tried; very fresh tasting. Also better than store bought price especially if you use subscribe and save.<br /><br />I got these in late December and they had around a 3 month expiration date. The have the standard potato, tomato, and spinach flavors. And like most brands I have bought in store they are not evenly placed in the bag, the potato flavor dominates. But not more than other brands, and these taste better and better priced at Amazon. Recommended."
5,soft & delicious licorice,Love this licorice.  It is very soft & tasty. Best licorice I have ever had. So glad I could find it on Amazon.
4,also contains honey,"After trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041NYV8E"">Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix, 6.72-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and quite liking it, I wanted to see if there was an unsweetened version of the drink.<br />This one seemed to be unsweetened, since amazon lists only ginger as sole ingredient.<br />I saw another review saying that the reviewer received only one box of the mix, but the seller sent her another 5 boxes at her request. I decided to try to buy it anyway. Well, I also got 1 box, and wrote to customerservice@dcdistributions.com asking for the rest of the order. They didn't answer me by email, but in about 10 days I got a box from them with the 5 missing boxes, and a whole bunch of samples. One would thing that after so many months had passed they would fix the problem, but it didn't happen so far.<br />As to the beverage itself, it does contain honey, and it is nice and smooth, not too spicy, not very sweet and quite drinkable."
3,Careful ingredient check,"The product tastes just fine, but contains more than just ground almonds and I wish I had pursued getting better product contents information before ordering several jars.  It also arrived in plastic containers that were all dented and distorted when they arrived which made me wonder if they had gotten overheated and some things just taste better in a glass jar.  It would be awesome to have a similar product without the palm oil and cane juice."
5,Oreo Dipped Delight Bars,These are our favorite indulgence at 100 calories for a sweet fix and energy- they are the best!  Sad to see on Amazon they are no longer available ;-(<br />Quick shipping and they arrived safely!
3,A little weak for me.,the Medium Roast is a little weak for me.  I am not using dark roast.  Good coffee.
5,Opposites Attract,"If you like dark chocolate combined with the sweet peanut butter taste, you should enjoy these peanut butter cups. To my taste the dark chocolate exterior acts as a foil to the peanut taste inside and accents it better than the milk chocolate. Bought these for the holidays and my sons and friends liked the chocolate also. They disappeared quickly. Dark chocolate is healthier for you than milk chocolate. It would be helpful to know what percent dark cocoa the coating of these are as nutritionists recommend above 70%. These are a great after-dinner or mid-afternoon treat.<br /><br />If you like dark chocolate and you like Reese's peanut butter cups, you should enjoy this tasty combination."
5,Wasabi+Soy=AWESOME,"The title says it all.<br /><br />The wasabi+soy flavors combine to a deliciousness that is out of this world.  If you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out."
5,Greatest stuff ever!,"I absolutely love PB2! Most of the time I just put some in a baggie and take it to work. During a break, I will pour a little water into the baggie and mix it by squeezing the bag a few times. That way I don't have to carry a spoon to work or wash a bowl when I get home. I dip a banana into the mixed up PB2 and have an awesome snack!<br /><br />  Another way that I like to eat it is mixed up in some plain Greek yogurt. I mix a spoonful of PB2 and a spoonful of sugar-free jelly into a 5.3 oz Oikos Greek yogurt container. It is delicious just like this or spread on some toasted thin buns. Mmmmm....mmmmmm!<br /><br />  The only downside is that I don't like it by itself. It has to be on a banana or an apple or be mixed with something."
5,A very pleasant surprise!,"I didn't know what to think about how hummus from a box would taste, but seriously, this stuff is delicious! It makes twice or more of what I've been buying at the supermarket already made in a small tub container at a fraction of the cost. I just put the required water in, mixed it with a regular fork, and since I wanted it to be just a bit more creamy, I added a little olive oil. This is NOT necessary to get great tasting hummus, though. It was just a personal consistency preference. I didn't have any pita bread in the house, but I did have some toasted pita chips and some thin, soft tortilla bread, and both worked perfectly for pairing with the hummus. I will DEFINITELY be back for more of this once I've used my 12 pack up. Absolutely!"
5,Best Salad Dressing Ever!,"Been using this for years and can no longer get it in grocery store. What a shame, it's a great product!"
5,Taste and consistency appear more to the real thing,"I grew up in the tropics where the best shade at the beach is from a palm tree. Of course, you gotta look up first to inspect if there are coconuts above. It might be dangerous when ripe. Oh! but locals climb palm trees to harvest the fruit.  With a machete they open up the top and voila, a super refreshing 40 to 50 calories drink.<br /><br />Zico water reminds me of the flavor tasted. I purchase it in Safeway and/or Trader Joe's ( I live in California now). Relatively cheap and likely the real thing without so much processing.<br /><br />I recommend it. Trust me. It is good. ;0)"
5,Packaged well,"I was a little worried about the packaging after reading reviews, but they shipped the original package in a larger/thicker bag.  It arrived safe and sound."
5,Best!,"These are the BEST chips ever!  I hate chips that are ruined by mass quantities of salt.  These chips actually taste like...wait for it...POTATO!  The only thing wrong with them is that they are so good I can't stop eating them!  Light, crisp, not greasy, and tasty.  Could it get any better?"
1,Not as good as the others,"I'm a big fan of Brothers fruit crisps. I've gotten the multi pack at Costco before and love all of those flavors (apple, pear, strawberry/banana). The peach are very bland and taste more like cardboard than peaches. My suggestion is to stick with Brothers but skip this flavor."
3,Not all organic is the same!,this product contains gelatin and other ingredients.  tastes great and my baby likes it but I prefer to feed her foods with less additives.
5,Great for my finicky eaters,"My 2 and 4 yr old drink these in the car.  It's a great snack for toddlers on the go with all the vitamins and minerals of fruit and veggies.  We don't prefer the other flavors though, but the Spinach Mango and Pear tastes great.  Even I like it :)"
4,"Good, but unremarkable","This medium-dark roasted Costa Rican varietal is a decent everyday brew. Unremarkable, but consistent, hard beans at a fair price. I have bought several coffees from CDB, and prefer a number of more distinctive coffees to this one. Try Ethiopian Yirgacheffe for a few more dollars."
3,Rather disappointed,"Though satisfied with the promptness of delivery, I found the flavor of the tea not up to what I expect from Twinings.  Oddly enough, the aroma of the packages is quite alluring.  I can smell it even in the wrapped box.  It is no doubt Lapsang Souchong, but once it is brewed it tastes like ordinary black tea.  While I intend to enjoy the entire set and try to alter my brewing technique,I will have to choose a different brand next time."
3,Its Okay,"Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Healthy<br />+Unique taste<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Unique taste<br /><br />Overall three stars. Remember that three stars means it just okay, I am not hammering this product as I am sure some people will very much so enjoy it. If you are taking it for health purposes than I am sure you won't mind the taste at all as it is great tasting for medicine."
1,Not so everlasting...,"I bought this dog toy in the smaller size, with great anticipation of finally having something that my 1/2 Yorkie-1/2 Shih Tzu wouldn't chew up and destroy in one afternoon.  From that standpoint, I would say the toy was a success, because it actually took him about 24 hours to eat the ends out of the toy, nab the treat disk and be done with it.  &lt;sigh>  I'm still on the hunt for SOMETHING that Buddy can't destroy.  This, unfortunately, was not it."
5,great isotonic drink,"Love Cytomax. When biking, I follow the instructions on the label on the proportions, when I use it for running, I cut it in half, it seems to be too much for me. Either way, love the product!"
5,Strong tea Great value,"The tea is strong enough for iced tea.  I like this better than other selections I have tried.  My guests are always impressed with the great tea - something I never heard before.  I always hear people comment on the quality of coffee but this is the first time I've had guests say, ""Boy, that's good tea!!"" (with sincerity)"
5,My favorite!,"I am not a coffee drinker but when I do drink coffee, I like it sweetened. This Cafe Mocha K-cup is a *perfect* blend. It's chocolatey-sweet coffee! And best thing is I don't need to add any sweetener or creamer. It's perfect as it is.<br /><br />Don't buy this if you expect it to be a more bitter coffee taste. This is more like the mocha blends you get at a coffee shop."
1,Not useful,"As we're being asked to shun the use of throwaway plastic bags, these biodegradable bags seemed like a great idea for my trash, so I bought 200 of them.  What a waste of money!  They may perhaps hold 3 gallons, but the dimensions do not fit any trash receptacle I've ever seen:  they are about 17"" wide but only 12"" of usable depth, so they really only work in a 1-gallon bucket."
2,Raisins great Seller not so much,"I first tried Champion raisins on a breakfast buffet while on vacation, they are softer, and more juicy than the brands our local store sells, so I have bought them at Amazon before. This purchase arrived in a padded mailing envelope, and one of the sealed packs,(each containing six small boxes)had been torn open, presumably to fit everything into the envelope. I would not trust eating food when the wrappers have been removed, no matter what the reason. It just got worse, the raisins had set someplace on the shelf,and were not as plump,and juicy as I remembered. Got to find another source !"
5,good,the SPAM alway good in the world even though this one. i and my firend try it and it test very good. i say: our life turn better than before.
5,Good stuff!,"This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  I use it at night, as I like my day products to contain an spf.  It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  It doesn't cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  My luck with Alba products has mostly been great with one exception.  The Sea renewal cream was way too oily and harsh on my skin.  Other than that, I've never been disappointed.  If you are looking for gentle, oil-free moisture, this is your golden ticket."
5,What fiber cheerios would taste like (if there were such a thing),"Having tried just about every fiber-branded cereal there is over the past couple of years, I would always pass by the Cheerios in the cereal section while grocery shopping and look to see if they had released a fiber version yet. Well, I can now happily report that my search for a consistently good-tasting fiber cereal are over. Don't get me wrong, there are a number of other competitor's products out there that are really good (Fiber One Shredded Wheat, for instance) but if you're a normal person, you will probably get sick of eating the same thing for breakfast in a matter of weeks or months. This cereal on the other hand, tastes great and never seems to get boring. It's lightly sweetened- just perfect as it isn't overly sweet or bland in flavor. It is pretty filling as most fiber cereals are, and is best enjoyed immediately after being immersed in milk so you can still enjoy the crunchiness of it(meaning it will get somewhat soggy if left sitting around for too long). I'm tempted to knock a star off for pricing as this is somewhat pricier and smaller-sized than competitors' offerings, but for how good the cereal tastes and the fact that I can't seem to get tired of eating it (going on 5 months now), I'd say its worth it to pay the small premium."
5,Best unsalted roasted in-shell peanuts!,I wanted to find a good unsalted in-shell peanut to feed our birds and wildlife. Hoody's classic unsalted roasted in-shell peanuts really fit the bill. The price was pretty good compared to what is available online. Our ground and desert rock squirrels are addicted to these peanuts. Give 'em a try!
5,FROSTING IS LIKE OLD FASHIONED HOME MADE,"We just love these mixes. They are all delicious.  My family loves cupcakes and these make great ones, 24 at at time. It is all I use now. I order them so as not to run out. The flavor and texture is like homemade. The frosting, which I am reviewing,  is fabulous.  I cannot stand the canned frosting...yuk. Do everyone a flavor favor and use real butter only for the frosting. (moderation)  It makes all the difference in the world. If the cake is not sweet enough for you just add a little sugar but for us it is just fine and  with the sweet frosting it is not a sugar overkill. I love it is all organic and tastes this good!  Easy to make too. The sprinkles that come with this are a nice taste/texture addition too and they also are all natural. Try the chocolate cake with vanilla frosting and yellow cake with chocolate frosting...yum!"
5,cherry chashew bar,"The best part about this bar is that (unlike most others) I cannot taste the dates.  They're a little sweet, but not too much so; the tartness of the cherries helps balance things out.  I take these with me for breakfast or a snack to classes, and it helps fight off any hunger while I get some protein.  I've also found that it is more filling if I drink it with something (juice or a bottle of water) and can make a quick meal.  I'm new this whole raw food thing, so these have been life-savers for when I'm tired of eating whole foods and salads."
5,"One Love, One Heart, One Great Coffee","Good coffee is in the palate of the coffee drinker. I think I have a good one. I love coffee. I drink it a lot, my friends say too much. But I can't help it, I'm gaga for coffee. I've reviewed a lot of coffee, said what I liked about it and now I get a chance to say what I like about this one.<br /><br />One, it's got an earthy taste that I just love and two, it's got almost a burnt aftertaste, almost like a whiff of the taste you might smell in the afternoon rain after the fields have been burned, getting ready for a new crop. I don't know if I'm saying that right, what I'm trying to describe is what I tasted on the air one time when I saw them burning fields in Malaysia.<br /><br />If you like good coffee, I think you'll like this one."
5,Love my bran,"I eat this cereal every morning.  I buy it by the case and reorder when my supply gets low.  This is the best raisin bran cereal I have found.  I served it to a guest one morning and his response was ...""this is the real deal!"""
5,A Taste of Italy is at your Door.,"A very delicious treat for all our party guest who asked for more. Serve with coffee, ice cream or just by itself. Easy to get through the Amazon connection."
5,Great for sensitive tummy,"I have a pug who vomits with every chicken based dog food I've tried, including other Iams flavors. This is the only dog food she can eat that, for the most part, stops the vomiting. All three of our dogs love it."
5,Easy and delicious,"I have bought these bars for years, but when I was no longer able to find them locally - I tried on Amazon!  Of course, ANYTHING you are looking for, you can find on Amazon!  I eat one of these bars with a cup of coffee in the morning as I like something to eat when I first get up.  Also great to have before going to workout.  They taste great!  I like the vanilla the best - but the peanut butter is pretty good too.  They are lower in calories and high in protein and taste great!  Happy with the bar!"
2,Weak and tasteless,"This tea has almost no aroma, it is very weak and pretty tasteless.<br />The reason I bought it is because my wife and I really loved <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DRJ6"">Dilmah Earl Grey Loose Leaf</a>, so we decided to try other Dilmah prodicts.<br />This one has disappointed us. I'd given it 3 stars if it was not sold at Premium price, but taken price/value into account, I only give it 2."
5,Grade A is not better than Grade B,"Grade B is simply harvested out of the prime season and has a depth and color that reflects this.  Grade C does not really exist anymore.  Maple syrup grades were redefined into two primary grades A and B with color differences within those to create more color grades.  I suspect this was done to push most of the formally grade B syrup into grade A for marketing purposes.  Since the general public assumes that Grade A is better than Grade B I can see why.  Grade B Syrups now take up what use to be Grade C and the darker Grade B.  This richly flavored and not quiet as sweet syrup is not for everyone and may not be best for cooking in some cases, but for pancakes and waffles this is the best."
5,"Better than any typical ""just out of the cow"" milk....EVER!","I first had instant whole dried milk when doing missionary work down in Honduras, CA. That dried milk happened to be either KLIM, a Borden product, or Nido, a Nestle's product. For all you dyslectics, you probably picked up on KLIM is just MILK spelled backwards......LOL.  I have had whole milk in the UK and even their full cream Jersey, gold topped, milk and thought that might be the best milk ever.  Matter of fact, I grew up in Houston, Texas and raised on a local dairy milk, Westmoreland.  During those days the very best milk was the one that was the creamiest and Westmoreland guaranteed that, as all their milk was from Jersey herds.  Peak easily surpasses that great ""fresh"" milk.  Not only does Peak taste great, not dried/instant, but it has the greatest milk taste ever.  I dare say that as long as I can order this stuff, I will never buy ""fresh"" milk ever again.  I am no longer a frequent milk consumer, but I do use it to make yogurt occasionally, on cereal, or even drink it, but rarely buy it as it typically goes bad/off before it is consumed.  Frankly, I do use it every morning in my coffee or tea.  I would recommend that it is made in a blender, chilled overnight, and then consumed.  I also have used half Peak and Sanalac powder to achieve a lower fat, but full flavored milk."
1,Very Disappointed :(,"I wouldn't even have given this 1 star, but there was nothing lower. I read a lot of the reviews on this product (Fettuccini miracle noodles) before buying, thinking it was going to taste great. I was extremely disappointed. It was the nastiest tasting noodles I have ever come across! I don't see how anyone could think these are good. I prepared them exactly the way the directions said, and when I tasted them, I was gagging, they were SO disgusting! I actually tried on several attempts to tolerate them, but all it did was confirm of how awful these noodles are. The noodles are slimy and have a horrible texture and taste. I was going to throw them out, but my daughter saw them and I was telling her how horrible they were. She wanted to take them home and try them. I told her to go for it, but she couldn't say that I didn't warn her! My daughter and I both are NOT picky eaters at all. She called me the next day and said they were sick and she threw up after eating them. I hope this review helps others who are thinking of buying these noodles. I wish there would have been more reviews warning me of how horrible these are, because I never would have bought them! Very disappointed :( P.S. I hope the bad reviews of this product are being posted."
5,Blu-Ray Review,"I give the blu-ray version of Beetlejuice five stars for the picture and sound quality alone.  The improvements compared to the previous DVD release are HUGE.  If I had to choose between warner spending money and time on a better transfer or more extra content, I would choose the better transfer.  After all, how many times are you going to watch behind the scenes material or a commentary?  It's been twenty years since this film was released, so it would be difficult for Tim Burton or anyone involved in the film to remember enough material for a commentary or even for short featurettes.  I'd rather have no commentary than a bad one.  This comes with a CD sampler of the soundtrack which is a nice addition.  I could care less about the episodes of the animated series even though I watched it as a kid.  My favorite aspect of this release is seeing the detail on the stop-motion puppets, the surreal set design, and Oscar winning makeup.  I can't recommend this enough."
5,BEST sugar substitute there is!,"I have tried every sugar substitute there is and this is by FAR the best.  No after taste, and because it is in a liquid form there is no unwanted carbs found in the powdered form.  For a large thermal mug of coffee that I would normally sweeten with 2 packets of Splenda, just 2 drops does the trick.<br /><br />A little goes a very long way.<br /><br />I have a friend who uses a minimum of 20 packets of Splenda a day. He tried EZ-Sweetz and it is now all he uses.<br /><br />I carry a bottle with me when I travel and feel good knowing I am cutting carbs and calories and not sacrificing taste.<br /><br />Give it a try, and I promise, it will not let you down.  It is a great value too!<br /><br />Enjoy!"
3,"Decent mix, requires eggs/milk/butter","I usually make pancakes/waffles from scratch, but I wanted to buy a mix to compare against the recipes I use, and for convenience.  I chose this particular mix because it's all-natural, it has good reviews, and Amazon has a great price.  Since receiving this mix, I've made waffles twice (chocolate and plain) and pancakes (plain and blueberry) once.<br /><br />Taste/texture: Making pancakes/waffles as directed, I felt both the pancakes/waffles were only so-so.  Adding vanilla extract, a little powdered sugar, orange zest, and miniature chocolate chips really helped.  However, I am a fan of plain pancakes, and would almost always prefer plain waffles/pancakes if they're really good.  The waffles/pancakes made from this mix are only so-so.<br /><br />Convenience: This mix requires that you add your own eggs, milk/buttermilk, and melted butter to the mix.  I had hoped that the mix would contain powdered egg and milk solids, so that I would only have to add milk or water, and would still be able to make it when I'm out of eggs.  No such luck.  From the ""bare pantry"" perspective, having this isn't much of an asset.<br /><br />Amazon has a great price on this product, but the dry ingredients of pancakes/waffles are even cheaper.  You can easily mix flour with a bit of baking soda, baking powder, salt, cornstarch, and (in some recipes) yeast, store it in Tupperware or Ziploc bags, then measure out what you need and add the wet ingredients whenever you want to make waffles/pancakes.  Alton Brown has a really simple recipe, and there are all sorts of other fabulous recipes online.  Depending on how much you pay for flour, you can probably save about $10 in 10 minutes by mixing your own dry ingredients."
5,"Num, num, num!","Larabar fruit bars are good, especially for we who have many food allergies.  But their Chocolate Coconut Chews are REALLY good!  I think I'm eating a tasty, moist brownie.  Yum!!!<br /><br />Sylvia"
5,Yum!,Very good product at a great price!  Got mine on sale which made it an even better deal.<br />Highly recommended
1,"overpriced, full of fillers","After buying this once, I realized how full of junk it was, like hydrogenated oil, thickeners like guar gum, and corn syrup solids, plus stuff I can't spell, let alone pronounce.  So now I just buy lactaid milk and it works fine.<br /><br />I was hoping for something that had extra vitamins in it and maybe omega-3s, but no such luck. Whiskas missed an opportunity here.<br /><br />Update:  I've upgraded my kitten lactaid milk to include taurine from capsules (jarrow), and whey based amino acid digest, I think it's called Amino Gold or something, meant for sports people.  I also add a little bit of ""miralax"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OZGG0K"">Kirkland LaxaClear, 90 Daily Doses, Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (3 Pack), Compare to Miralax Active Ingredient</a> but only a little bit.  Of all these things, I add a tiny tiny bit.  My cats weigh about 10 lbs each, so figure 20 lbs of feeding, that's about 1/5 of a 100 lb teenager.  I also water it down about 1:3 parts water:lactaid.<br /><br />They LOVE it, beg for it.  Two cups of it is gone in a day.  Be prepared to clean the litterbox every night though.  But it's good for them to be hydrated.  I haven't decided how to get more Omega-3 into this yet.  Maybe add almond milk?  They seem to like almonds and are after me if I eat them.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VKIK0"">Jarrow Formulas Taurine 1,000mg Capsules, 100-Count</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJZV86"">Ultimate Nutrition Amino Gold Capsules, 1000 mg, 250-Count Bottles</a><br /><br />They drink it between meals.<br />Did I mention cats like parmesan cheese?  I'm considering adding parmesan as a flavorant to make it even more irresistible.

5,This is my Coffee,I was surprised when I found this deal.  I always have coffee in my house and it is sometimes hard to find the Caribou.  This 96 count is a great way to save on this coffee.
5,LOVE,"Reminds me of when I was younger, everybody has fawn memories of the product. Its like being a kid again, no matter what age you are."
5,Yummy Cake Mix,"Pamela's Classic Vanilla Cake Mix is a must for your pantry.  It's great for cupcakes or standard cakes; and it's fun to add fruit on top such as strawberries.  Don't over-bake this product, and add frosting even when it is a little warm; seems to seal in the moisture.  It's our top choice for cake mixes.  The best price is on Amazon.com."
1,real bad,This is the first time I try canned eel. It was the worst eel i've ever had.<br />Another thing is that each 3.7 oz serving contains 50% daily fat.
4,"All babies love to eat their greens, don't they?","What makes this product unique is how it has been packaged.  The baby food comes in pouches that have pourable spouts for ease of storing, packing for daycare, and you can open and shut them.  They are pourable and the plastic pouch is durable.  I personally didn't eat any of these organic baby meals but a friend's little boy did and he ate it all with no discernible complaints."
5,Great deal on K-cups!,"It's wonderful that you offer K-cups in ""bulk"" and at a great price too! For sure I'll be purchasing more through Amazon and in different flavors too. Ordering was very easy and shipment received before expected. Thanks lots."
5,Highly Recco'd,"All my pets get the best that I can give them. I researched long and hard to find the perfect food for my boxer (5mo), and this was highly recommended on the boxer forums I frequent (backed up by independent research). DFA website gives TOTW a 6* rating! The fowl version did make my girl gassy, but the bison (yellow bag) is Wonderful!<br /><br />She's growing steady, lean (as boxers should be), playful, beautiful, shiny, and soft. She eats smaller portions vs. her old food (no fillers!); really has smaller, firmer stools as well (uses more of the food). Even her breath smells good! Yard is pretty easy to clean up now too.<br />She came to me with an awful ear infection-- it has not recurred since the switch a few months ago. Our vet had never heard of this food... but she said it looks like our girl is doing Great on it.<br /><br />Our pup is always excited at mealtimes... she LOVES it... and I love that I can afford it, and we are far from rich.  In a perfect world I would feed raw, but TOTW is a great alternative.<br /><br />This food is right up there with the best of the best quality grain-free kibbles..."
5,Best Breakfast Tea ever,This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea-drinking household. We love it and it really starts the morning off right. Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites?? The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day.
1,FYI- BEFORE YOU BUY Miracle Noodles PLEASE READ THIS!,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: &lt;...>. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???"
5,Great decaf coffee,"This is one of the best decafs that we have tried, not too strong , not too light. It makes for a good cup of breakfast coffee and one does not even remember is decaf."
5,"Only ""greens"" I can stand.","I don't eat greens. I needed them in my diet, so I tried several ""greens"" products, the taste of grass just makes me gag, the aftertaste makes me dry heave. This Amazing Grass Berry Flavor fixed that. It doesn't taste great, don't expect this to taste like Ocean Spray, but the berry flavor does definitely overpower the ""green"" flavor. The aftertaste is a refreshing not too sweet berry flavor. I like to put a scoop of this in with a scoop of pea protein in the mornings. Good stuff."
5,Yummy,"Love, love it. The only way to improve is make it so it can be heated up .  Bought a box and ate it right out of box"
5,Healthy - but pricey,"Like another reviewer, I'm in the same boat with puppy allergies. My dog is very allergic to chicken - even just two of those chicken jerky (all natural) treats has her with flaky skin and itching by the next day - and it's extremely hard to find dog food that doesn't at least use chicken fat, if not chicken meat as filler due to the comparatively low cost of poultry.<br /><br />My pup is thriving on Orijen Six Fish. Her coat is shinier than it has ever been (it took a very long time and multiple brands of dog food to figure out that chicken was the problem). Her muscle tone has always been decent (she's a dobe/sheppard mix) but now those muscles are 'sculpted', and although she's never been over-weight, her waistline has also never been so well defined. She is sleek, shiny, bright eyed, and always full of energy. Prior to the Orijen her coat was dull and flaky constantly. You could feel sores under her coat and on rare occasions she'd have to go to the vet for steroid shots. Even on Wellness, Evo, Taste of the Wild, etc, etc, good brands all, nothing worked for my dog's issues until the Orijen.<br /><br />On the down side, the price is outrageous for dog food. It's that simple. And although I've seen many reviews (elsewhere and one on here) giving the argument that ""but because it's better quality food your dog will eat less"", I have to disagree with that and say, if anything, Mazzy eats more of the Orijen than she ever did those other foods. I don't know if that's simply because she feels better (she also used to burp constantly and I worried about bloat) or if she just likes the taste a lot more, but she used to eat maybe 3 cups of food per day - maybe, and with the Orijen, she will easily eat four cups, and sometimes wake up in the night for a fifth (I semi-free feed, adding one cup at a time to her bowl when I see it empty). That's a lot of money at $40+ for only 15 pounds.<br /><br />I do think it's an excellent food, but if your dog does well on something else, I'd say go with that instead because Orijen is going to be more expensive AND hard to find if you aren't ordering online."
5,Lover of Twinings Tea,"For those of you who love Twinings Four Red Fruits, there is a reason why Four Red Fruits has been disappearing from store shelves. Twinings has recently changed this tea's name and packaging. It's new name is Mixed Berry. Mixed Berry is the same tea blend as Four Red Fruits; only the name has changed.<br /><br />Twinings USA sells this tea at a good price. [...]<br />I recommend that you also try Blackcurrant Breeze (formerly Blackcurrant) and other Twinings flavors. Twinings has a wonderful line of black teas, herbal teas, and also rooibos teas.<br /><br />No, I don't work for Twinings of London. However I do love their teas!"
5,So this is what actual salt tastes like,"Forget the bright white, perfectly crystallized salt you're used to seeing in your grinder - Real Salt is the completely unprocessed version of the same thing, retaining all of the minerals and beneficial compounds that are lost otherwise. Apart from the pinks, reds and grays you'll see in the packet, the most obvious difference is the taste and it can really help draw out the flavors in your cooking. Regular table salt apparently has a range of chemical additives, none of which are present here so if you like your food unprocessed, Real Salt is an essential ingredient in your kitchen."
5,Has everything my pet needs for nutrition,Flint River dog food has all the nutrition my pet needs.<br />Finally food that she actually takes time to chew.
1,Aroma free and tasteless.,"I guess it had to happen sooner or later but this is my first disappointment buying from Amazon. No aroma when the bag was opened and totally tasteless. I bought in spite of the negative reviews and now will man up and regret it. Too bad because it was to be my first subscribe and save experience. After contacting customer service full credit was issued, subscribe and save cancelled and I was asked to dispose of the item. Five Stars for Amazon!"
2,"Too Salty, not shucked",I've discovered that these have too much salt on the shells and not enough inside. I personally would prefer shelled pumpkin seeds (so that the salt is on the kernel). It would also be less work. =)<br />My wife liked them at first but the 12 pack ended up being too much for her since I wasn't eating them too.
5,"Great flavor, good buy",What a Kind deal! You won't regret this way of being Kind to yourself! The variety is excellent--a taste for every bud!
5,Worth Every Penny - Wellness CORE dry and Wellness Grain Free canned,"Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting.  After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.<br /><br />She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.<br /><br />Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to ""getting older"" or her ""hairball sensitivity"" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.<br /><br />After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.<br />Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.<br /><br />I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's pricy, sure.  But it's worth it for us.  Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two.  I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store.  So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man."
5,Good for your little one and taste great,"I'm very happy with the Eath's Best Organic foods. I generally try to give my daughter organic food whenever possible just for good health.<br /><br />It can be difficult as she's a picky eater and often doesn't like to eat whole vegetables because of their texture. She's happily eaten these carrots since she was an infant and even now at three years old, she's always happy to eat them.<br /><br />Order with the amazon subscribe and save to get them a bit cheaper and save the gas and time it would take to make a trip to the store."
5,Keurig K-cups,I love the k-cup variety pack received. It's a very nice selection of coffees. My husband is the coffee drinker in the family. He enjoys the variety packs too!
5,Every day is a Caturday!,"My cats loved this treat!  I didn't like the packaging, because it's really just a one-time portion unless you vacuum seal the rest.  Plus, the fish is in huge pieces, not really ready for feeding cats.<br /><br />It's best for cats who refuse to eat due to illness, medication, etc.  I found this tuna dissolved off the dishes in a blink of a cat's eye."
5,Excellent Beans!,These beans arrived quickly and the quality was fantastic!  The beans were moist and easy to use.  The flavor was amazing and I will definately be ordering these beans again.
3,Too Rich for my dogs,"I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the ""organ"" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!"
5,Good Stuff!!,"Just got my boxes of cereal yesterday.  If I had a sugar scale for this cereal where 10 was ""Frosted Flakes"" and 1 was cardboard, I'd give it a 4.  If you removed the dried strawberries it would be a 3.  It's not too sweet for me.<br /><br />Overall I think that the nutrition level of the cereal is excellent.  Caloric content combined with its whole grain contents holds me over 5 hours until noon without cheating.  It has an excellent ratio of non-soluble to soluble fiber.<br /><br />It has its own distinct flavor that won't get boring and this cereal can be mixed with yogurt or whatever your favorite mix is and will be tasteful.<br /><br />It is lightly crispy and does well in milk.<br /><br />It's a keeper.  I'm glad I brought it."
5,Excellent GLUTEN FREE muffins that anyone will enjoy!,"We tried Namaste Muffin Mix after the brand had been recommended to us by a fellow shopper at the grocery store. We've tried many of their other products and feel they've all performed reliably with good flavor and texture. The muffins were of particular interest to me, as I have 4-year old twins who must now be on a gluten-free diet. I am an avid baker, so prior to the change in diet, we had been making our muffins from scratch. When we had to go gluten free, I was a little overwhelmed by the many ingredients and the combinations of those ingredients needed to achieve ""wheat-like"" results. After trying one bag of this mix, my children were raving about the muffins and so happy that they could enjoy one of their favorite snacks again.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I would suggest trying add-ins to really create the muffin flavor/texture you're after. I basically think of the Namaste mix as a great, convenient muffin base. We regularly add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of milled flax (to add some fiber, which most GF mixes seem to be lacking), 1 or 2 ripe, mashed bananas (this sweetens it up), 1-2 tsp. of vanilla, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and a handful of mini chocolate chips. We've also made cranberry muffins using dried organic cranberries and 3 Tbs. chia seeds, and ginger muffins, adding dried, crystallized ginger and just a little ground ginger (amount is a matter of preference). A few times, when we were out of banana, we tried adding pumpkin puree in it's place, but each time had muffins that were a little ""soggy"" (clearly a result of adding too much puree). I would urge folks to tinker with flavors and add-ins, but do it slowly, so that you know how much of any particular ingredient the mix will tolerate. I've found that the ingredients used in GF baking have a narrower tolerance for experimentation.<br /><br />I would also add that these muffins (and it seems GF products in general) don't have the same shelf life as their wheat counterparts. I would recommend refrigerating or freezing unused portions, and then thawing/reheating (in toaster oven works fine) as you go. Another thing is that we now regularly use paper liners, which we never did before going gluten-free. I would strongly recommend using them, at least the first couple times you bake (or maybe it's just all the ""tinkering"" we do).<br /><br />Perhaps the best endorsement for this product is the disappearance of an entire plate of muffins at a recent school picnic. I'd given another mom a bag of this mix, as she was aware of our GF diet and wanted to make something for the picnic that my kids could eat, but just didn't know how to go about it. I gave her a bag, and literally said, ""You can't go wrong!"" She brought them to our gathering and by the time I went to grab a muffin for myself, they were ALL GONE (eaten and enjoyed by all).<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention is that Namaste mixes seem to have some of the lowest sodium levels of GF mixes currently offered on the market. Read your labels, because many of the GF mixes out there have ENORMOUS amounts of sodium (probably a result of the leavening used).<br /><br />These are a favorite in our home!"
4,good product at good price,"I'm a baker and I use this brand of coconut milk all the time.  I like it as much as the more expensive Chaokoh brand.  Coconut milk prices have been rising over the past couple of years, and this is one of the best prices I have found.  My only issue with my experience ordering it from Amazon was that my case of cans seemed to have been sitting around in a warehouse for quite some time--all the milk was completely separated, leaving a thick pasty mass at the bottom of each can and a translucent water.  Shaking the cans was impossible; I had to open up the cans, scrape out the contents and do my best to whisk it all back together (which works for the most part, but it's impossible to get it completely lump-free). I realize coconut milk needs to be shaken before use, but I've never experienced settling to this degree. Looks like Amazon probably doesn't have a huge turnover rate for this product, so the cases sit around too long and the milk separates. For this reason I deduct one star.  Otherwise this is a good product at a decent price."
5,Great!,"I like em a lot, wife thinks they're the best cereal she's ever had, teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food, the others here like them enough.  Bags are pretty small but still a good enough deal that I'll buy again, just too good (and a unique flavor...really like the pumpkin seeds in them) not to."
5,"Great price, great quality!","With Subscribe-n-Save and Prime I'm saving so much over buying ""natural"" or organic canned beans and veggies at my local Walmart.  Very good quality product."
3,She must be a picky eater.,"My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats..."
5,BIG bag!,"The package was even larger than I expected!  The bag is roughly 1'x1.5'x0.5' and contained at least 20 10-inch rawhide rolls.  It has a printed expiration date on the bag (2 years from the time I purchased them, which is far more than adequate for my heavy chewer).  According to the information printed on the product, the rolls are 100% beefhide and made in Paraguay.<br /><br />So far my 3 year old 25lb terrier mix is crazy about them. She can go through one roll in a few hours, but I usually let her have half of one every few days."
5,Fresh Pop Tarts are Magically Delicious,I guess I have never had a pop tart as fresh as these. They were delivered quickly and each pop tart was sturdy and not cracked like store bought can be. These are the best flavor assortment and quality pop tarts ever. Trustable.
5,Slim Jim's are the best!,"I love Slim Jim's. I was spending a small fortune buying them from convenience stores. I typically eat 3 per day [...] Now, from Amazon, I can get a month's supply for only [...] Thanks, Amazon! Because of you, my kids can go to college now!!"
5,Happy Kitty,"Our kitty is spoiled she gets tuna, lunch meat, wet food, dry food and once in a while a little ice cream. :) But her all time favorite thing has to be temptation treats(all flavors). She will sprint across the house when I get home, jump on the bed and wait for her treats to be delivered. We were worried she was overweight but the vet says she's in great health and a little ""fluff"" is to be expected on a house cat."
5,Excellent sugar-free candy,"I have tried jelly-beans, chocolate, cookies, etc. that were all sugar-free, but these gummy bears were the best of the bunch. I am not a fan of gummy candies, but these had excellent flavor and the texture and freshness were great. It satisfied my candy craving and did not cause any teeth problems. Keep up the good work with this product."
5,favorite blend,"many of the K cups ive tried arent strong enough or flavorful when brewing a large cup. Our of all the cups ive tried, which is alot, this is my personal favorite. Does just right with a large cup without being weak. Highly reccomend."
5,Why is this tea not famous and widely available?,"You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink."
5,Best tiny treats out there!!!,"My dogs are all on very limited ingredient diets, and the Itty Bitty Buddy Biscuits Sweet Potato flavor perfectly compliments what we are feeding all of them. Most importantly, my dogs LOVED these cute little treats! They fit perfectly in a treat dispensing toy, and tend to stay in longer than the other treats I have used due to their odd shape. I have not had any issues with crumbled cookies in any of my purchases, and I buy these on the regular!<br /><br />Our cupboards are only lined with Cloud Star treats (all are corn and soy free, and made with only USA-made/sourced ingredients). This company gives back too - they supported my local shelter with samples and free goods for a recent fundraiser. Can't say enough great things about Cloud Star and their amazing line of yummy treats!"
5,My go-to coffee subsitute,"Dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure, which is why I drink it.  I've pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute, though one must acquire a taste for it.  At home I use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel."
1,Oily taste,"These chips were disappointingly oily tasting and somewhat stale, even out of a freshly opened bag. I even opened a second bag to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. The chips are crisp enough, but taste like they were fried in old oil."
5,Best Chips Ever...,"Popchips are tasty and healthy. I enjoy a bag everyday for my afternoon snack, they are satisfying and don't make you feel weighed down."
5,Kettle Chips,"I have found this product, Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous.  I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores.  They are crisp and tasty without all of the salt."
1,Fake San Marzano in a Can,"I bought this brand at a grocery store and by chance am cooking side by side with a can of DOP San Marzano tomatoes from Dani Coop.  Major difference is this San Marzano brand apparently (from what I read on internet) is San Marzano variety of plum tomatoe that they grow in Italy except it is grown in California under different conditions.  The San Marzano brand is much lighter, almost watery flavor and it does not immediately breakdown i.e. still alot of chunks after slow cooking for 30 minutes.  The Dani Coop had intense flavor, a bit on the acidic side and immediately brokedown into a sauce once I put it on the burner.  There is a major difference in price as the Dani Coop is around the same price as the SM brand except it is 14.1 oz instead of 28 oz.  I would not buy the SM brand again given I was deceived on the San Marzano label (and the expensive price!).  I will try other San Marzano brands."
4,My dog likes it,My dog likes this product.  That is most important.  It doesn't have a foul odor...  The description says you can break it in pieces... you can but it is a bit dry and pieces don't come off in the same size consistently.  Overall I would recommend.
2,SUGAR FREEEEE,CAN'T THEY MAKE A SUGAR FREE FOOD WITHOUT PUTTING EXLAX MALITOL IN IT?. I GUESS I DID READ THE LABEL. WATCH  FOR THE DIAREA.!!!!!!
1,Incorrect packaging,"I never received this product as inside the box marked ""Variety Pack"" was 18 packages of Chocolate flavored coffee pods.  After this happening 2 times, the order was cancelled."
5,Best Gluten Free Pretzels,These pretzels are the best I have tried since switching to a gluten free diet approximately 2 years ago.<br /><br />I would definitely buy them again.
5,Very good for a box mix,"While not the same as a homemade carrot cake, this mix will make an acceptable substitute. It reminded us of carrot cake and a bit like a spice cake. Mildly spiced with an acceptable taste. The box cake did not taste quite as moist as a homemade carrot cake but it was good.<br /><br />I frosted the box carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and most everyone enjoyed eating it.<br /><br />Recommend."
4,Good product for a good price and my cat likes it.,"Once my cat, Starlight, ate Petite Cuisine she was hooked. I was pleased to get the subscription price as it is significantly less than anyplace else and I never run out. When one order got lost in the mail, they overnighted a new shipment at no additional cost."
5,Fresh,"Even though this is a can product, the fresh taste is great. I received this product last month.  I have already used six of the dozen cans. I will be ordering this product again. If you are on the french about this product, don't be, you will love this organic product."
5,"My favorite k-cup, hand down, no question","I am a coffee lover. Drink it all the time, prefer dark roasts with full flavor and typically drink it black unless i crave a drop of honey. I used to buy the very expensive dark roast K-cups but i saw these on sale and decided to try them based on the good reviews. First, the cup itself is awesome.  Far less plastic than 'regular' K-cups, so there's less waste. The flavor is awesome-- dark brew but no bitterness or sourness.  Nice bite, clean aftertaste.  This, in my opinion, tastes more like my local coffee house brew than any other K-cup on the market.  and Amazon has great prices on these, especially with subscribe & save."
5,Best 'instant' mac & cheese on the market,"I first found these at Safeway, thought they were wonderful but then they disappeared.  I was delighted to find Amazon has them, and I'm on my 2nd box now.  I'm also introducing them to my daughter and granddaughters."
5,cheese please for the team house spaghetti,"It is great to be able to order this product on line for spaghetti suppers when you live in a third world country and cannot buy this at a store or at the market.  It is not deli, or home grated fresh parmesan, but no complaints. The pack of 3, 16 oz jars is right for a 12 person team!  Keeps well."
2,Horrible,"This is the worst split pea soup I have ever tasted. There are way too many onions... I usually like a lot of onions in soup, but this was ridiculous. There were more onions than peas! It tasted more like I was eating onion soup with ""split pea"" flavor. On top of that, the onions did not even taste fresh, they were bitter. Amy's usually makes great products, but they desperately need to change this soup. I give it 2 stars only because it is healthy, and there might be a small chance of someone liking this if they like tons of onions.<br /><br />Walnut Acres' Split Pea soup used to be perfect, but they changed their recipe recently after I reviewed it. It is still ok and still tastes better than Amy's Split Pea.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZLJY"">Walnut Acres Organic Soups, Split Pea, Fat Free, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"
5,best,"If you like a strong and smooth coffee that wakes you up, this is the one."
5,Great taste,I bought these to give away on Halloween and they were a success...especially with moms!! Great taste and good for you!
5,I don't know whether to give this 1 star or 5,This is the HOTTEST hot sauce I've EVER had. Nothing is ever hot enough for me and this is WAY TOO HOT. I ate a quarter sized bit in my tomato soup and now I think I'm going to have a heart attack and die. D: Goodbye cruel world.
5,EXCELLENT!,"Being gluten free you shouldn't expect items made from rice flour to taste the same as those made from wheat flour. That being said, these pizza shells are excellent. It's so great to be able to eat pizza again. I've been eating a pizza every day since I received them. This is my first exposure to Ener-G foods and I am very impressed. After amazon warehouse deals sent me some moldy and fermented shells, the staff at Ener-G sent me a replacement at no cost. They were overwhelmingly friendly and professional. Highly Recommend!!! Just don't expect it to taste like pizza made from wheat."
5,"Oh my goodness, YUM!","These chocolate bites are simply heavenly. So perfectly creamy. They taste DECADENT--you would never guess that they're sugar free!! Plus, perfect portion-size control--you can have one bite for less than 40 calories, or 2 for around 70!!! WONDERFUL. I only wish I could access them more easily, it's so expensive online and hard to find in the store! Worth it, though!"
5,Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot Cereal,Bob's Red Mill anything is always good.  We enjoy cooked cereal and have been buying this at our local grocery for years<br />when they have it on the shelf.  We like both the organic oat bran as well as the original oat bran.
5,"Some aftertaste, but still good","Yes, it does have artificial sweetener.  Yes, you can taste it.  I haven't had any artificial sweetener that I couldn't notice.  It's not a super-strong taste though, at least to me.  My daughter tried it and liked it, I didn't even tell her it was in it till after.  Honestly, regular apple cider is just too sweet for me anyway, so this is just as good cuz I'm replacing the slight dislike of too sweet with a slight dislike of artificial.  If you're super-sensitive to the artificial flavor and you don't like any of it then avoid this.  Otherwise, you should try it out.  It's going to just come down to a personal taste preference thing for everyone."
4,"A good buy, essential for gluten-free baking","This is a good buy in this quantity - though to preserve it, I pour some into a jar with a lid that screws tight, and reclose and seal the bag carefully until it's needed.  The jar sits with my baking supplies and I measure the xanthan gum from that as needed.  I do wish it were sold in a container made to reclose tightly."
3,Not Strong Enough!!! Lacks Full Flavors & Sophistication,"Ok, I've been drinking a variety of hot teas usually with cream & a tad of sugar since the late 1970's... before that iced tea...<br /><br />Amazon did sell this at an excellent price 'IF' you subscribe & it arrived promptly with a VERY FRESH date... expiration in 2013 for best flavor (bought in August 2011).<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea is too weak & too smooth... I have to use 3 tea bags per 10-11oz cup of water to get some strength infused into it for 10 minutes! I recommend Lifeboat Tea (also from UK) over this or Scottish Breakfast if you want even more strength & full flavors.<br /><br />If you don't want strong Full Flavors or Sophistication, then this tea is a buy for smooth & subtle drinking... good for a tea party... to eat little cakes & scones with it. Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast, imo, for my tea parties. :-)<br /><br />Right now, my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat... Lifeboat needs a tiny kick of strength & flavor from the Scottish tea... that's my perfect cuppa tea...<br /><br />If you know a better stronger blend that can top that combo taste, then please comment to this post... and Thanks!!!"
2,$70!,"It may not be fair for me to review this.  I sent it out to Uncle Johnny just yesterday.  But when I think about it, that box of dried fruit and nuts can't be all that big, and certainly not worth $70.  But somehow that's what my total came out to by the time I was at the end.  I think it was the shipping that did it.  I love my uncle Johnny, but that really hurt.  I found something that looked nice and was in my price range and then once I click ""submit"" I got a total of $69.+!!!  I was LIVID!  And I can't help but muttering to myself over and over now- if I'm going to give out $70 to someone as a gift, I certainly want them to get $70 worth of something.  So, I guess in the long run, it's not the product I'm reviewing, it's the shipping scam.<br />And these businesses who started with a wonderful idea, have turned our sympathies to just that- A SCAM.  I can not longer support them.  I'm out.  There are other ways I can say I love you, or I'm sorry your wife died."
5,My #1 Favorite K-Cup tea!,"I love this tea!  I am trying to wean myself off of soft drinks and drink more tea, but don't want to get a tea that I have to add artificial sweeteners or spoonfuls of sugar & milk to get it to taste palatable.  This tea is easy, just run it through the brewer & go-so it is fast & convenient.  Smooth, sweet flavor without being overpowering.  Just right.  I make it with the least scant amount of water necessary for a full-bodied taste; but you can also do the opposite & add more water if you want less taste.  It is all up to you."
5,"Flavorful, Tart and thick. A Little goes a long way.","A very lemony and delicious Lemon curd. The texture is not particularly smooth or creamy as some, more dense and geletin like. A little goes a long way, so for the value it is packed with flavor! Dickinson's products are always excellent, and I will buy this one again."
5,Super treat product for dogs,My large Corgi mix loves these. They are great as treats and/or crumbled and mixed in with his food. Found these to be much cheaper than at my local store.
4,One of my faves,"I used to eat Special K with strawberries every morning.  I switched my cereal entirely to Kashi and although this isn't my number one anymore, it is definately better than Special Ks version to me."
5,Tasty and Good for You!,This is the perfect morning perk me up.  The tea brews nicely and has just a hint of jasmine flavors (not overpowering at all).
5,great tea,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004777F3M"">Celestial Seasonings  English Breakfast Black Tea, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a><br />This tea has a great, smooth flavor. Even my husband, who is not a tea drinker, enjoys a cup of this."
4,Bewildering and delicious candy!,"I first tried this candy while out on a hike, and decided that I needed to get some of my own! It's like a cross between a nerd and a jelly bean, with the outside being hard and sour while the inside is soft and sweet. Also, the different colors actually do indicate distinct flavors, which I always appreciate in a candy. Oh, and by giant, they mean about jelly bean size, but they range in size from about 1/4 of an inch to 3/4 of an inch. The only down side to this product is that inside the package are 24 ""small"" packets of the candy, which is a LOT of packaging and bad for the environment. For me, the packets are also too big for a single serving (I get a sugar overload about halfway through one.) In short:<br /><br />Good:<br />- Amazing delicious candy<br />- Bewilderingly textured, which makes them really fun<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Too much packaging (I would rather just buy a big bag of loose candies)<br />- Single packets are too big for single serving"
5,Just what I wanted,"My local Safeway only orders this product during the Thanksgiving/Christmas season. Once their stock runs out, its gone till next season. I got hooked on putting walnuts on my salads because my doctor said to eat healthier and sent me to a nutritionalist for a class on proper eating. I ordered these on Amazon and the total price w/membership in Prime shipping is less than what I paid at Safeway for the same amount. They're fresh and taste great."
5,Magosteen 100 by Genesis Today,"This is the Best By Far Mangosteen juice on the market in my opinion.Not a Bad taste and packed with Nutrients and Vitamins.<br /> Magosteen is Basically like a liquid super mutivitamin and Good for a Multitide of things.This is probably one of the Best things out there to buy in reference to an all around Health Supplement.In my opinion everyone should have this one in there Betallion of Daily Nutritional supplements.<br />This will give you: energy,stamina,Make you feel Good,Really Good for Skin conditions of all kinds,musculer problems,a Great Blood Purifier and Highly Recommended for Cancer Patients.<br />Take Care,<br />Just My Opinion.<br />Whats yours??"
4,Just don't set it next to your roll-on deodorant... :),"Imagine doggie treat flavored underarm deodorant.... have to squeeze just a bit to get the roller wet, then turn upside down and let the dog lick it. Unique idea.  Would probably be useful as a training tool. Our dog definitely likes it.  I imagine this works best as a daily treat. I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!! I'm just saying...  :)<br /><br />All in all, worth a try for the dog that has everything or just needs a change of taste...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
5,"Peak whole dried milk, wonderful","I bought Peak whole dried milk a few months ago, and it is yummy and wonderful! While I am lactose intolerant, I take a digestive capsule with lactase and other digestive aids (getting older!) and it seems to work. I use it for my gluten-free oatmeal that only takes a minute of boiling water, add a spoon or two of this, and I am in heaven for a while! Fresh blueberries and again, a heaping spoon of this, a bit of lactose-free milk for liquid, a little sugar- and back into heaven again. I can't tell you how WONDERFUL it tastes after years of  2% milk on everything!"
5,Inspired MAYHEM!,"***** 5 stars!<br />Send them to your<br />Two faced relation's<br />Progeny.....<br />With ad/hd issues.....<br />Guaranteed to light 'em right up!<br />Mix and match with heavy metal Black Dean Dimebag Darrell ML guitars, with 15w  practice amps.<br />And a few of these barrels of  sugar.""pooka's""<br />Add an AC/DC songbook!<br />130db Christmas ...ho ho ho...<br />No thank you from cousin, though<br />Only her two tweenage boys!<br /><br />Counter top candy displays<br />Rock kids worlds<br />Create a real special memory<br />For a pittance!<br />Treat a family kid to these,...<br />You'll get twenty eulogies someday!<br />Guaranteed ringers!"
5,The secret to making my Pitbull sane!!!!,"My one year old pit can be very hyperactive- I bought this just today and at first was a bit disapionted that he kept getting the treat out becuase it was in one of the edge compartments.  Then I tried fiddling with it and managed to stick it in the middle which made it much harder to get to.  After playing a little one sided fetch he's still trying to get at the treat.  It's amazing that something has such power to amuse him for so long! I recommend this toy, especially to puppy owners.  It works wonders."
2,I used to love Caribou coffee.,"Save your $$ here.  There are so many other better k-cups out there.  Caribou coffee was one of my favs, but their quality has gone down significantly over the past few years.  This blend tastes very weak-too bad used to love it."
5,Delicious & Nutritious,I am so happy I purchased this. I put it in my morning green smoothies in addition to drinking throughout the day. I prefer the taste over regular bagged green tea. We also use ut to make home made mochi.
5,Great Flavor,"Like many of the other reviews, I have tried coconut water and hated the taste. I do love chocolate and had a free sample of this and was hooked. Since these sell in NY for about $3 a bottle I decided to buy the cases. As soon as I saw that amazon only had a few left I bought 4 boxes. Hopefully they get more in stock when I am ready.<br /><br />Side note: I used to get really bad headaches at work and now that I drink one with my lunch I feel much better (refreshed). I highly recommend giving it a try."
4,Great Tasting Vegan Jerky!,"I was looking for an alternative meat source for a backpacking trip my husband and I are taking soon and discovered this great tasting vegan meat jerky. It tastes great, but is a bit to salty for my tastebuds"
4,Fine Hot Chocolate,"It tastes fine, but there is always some Palm kernel and undissolved cocoa left at the end of drinking though."
5,Another fantastic ZiwiPeak product!,"It should have been no surprise to me that the ZiwiPeak canned venison is a hit with my dog as he already enjoys the ZiwiPeak Air Dried Venison Dog Food...but I was indeed surprised at HOW MUCH he loves the ZP canned.  I've been feeding my dog, Titan, another brand of canned dog food so that I could hide his different medications and get him to eat them without having to wrestle his powferful jaws like the late beloved Crocodile Hunter.  While he enjoyed this other brand of 100% venison canned food, he was on to me with the whole pill hiding thing and would root around his bowl and eat around the pills.  Titan is a food motivated dog (you'd think he was a lab rather than a pittie) and usually I could count on telling him to sit, give me paw and then literally drop the ball of wet food with the pills hidden inside into his mouth and he would gulp them down.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, he wouldn't eat the wet in his dish, and when I tried the old 'drop in his mouth' trick, he let the ball of wet food hit him in the snout and didn't even lick it off; he just watched me pick up the mess and waited for me to wipe off his face.<br /><br />Enter ZP canned.  First, this stuff doesn't look like normal canned food.  It has such a fresh quality to it.  Titan loved it instantly.  In fact, I don't even have to hide the pills anymore.  I feed him just like an 80+ baby, spoon feeding him right from the can, except that I place a pill on the spoon as it goes in his mouth.  No getting my hands all messy with shaping the canned food around a pill to conceal it from him.  Titan knows the pill is in there, and as long as he gets a mouthful of the ZP canned, he doesn't care.<br /><br />Oh, and he won't even touch the old stuff with or without pills.  He knows he's moved on up in the quality of food  and there's no turning back!"
5,"Excellent sugar free chocolate, and a recipe for you","I have reviewed their almond and cherry chocolate bars on those product pages.<br />I also tried the plain dark, which was excellent for tempering.<br /><br />Here's the recipe for a lacy bark with sun-dried mulberries, roasted cashews, and brown rice crispies, though you can add-in whatever you like.<br /><br />My little confections turned out fabulously, and the chocolate tempered perfectly.<br /><br />Break one bar into 15 sections.<br />Set aside four of them.<br />Chop these four into small shards and divide equally.<br />Put the remaining 11 into a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup and nuke on 75%-100% power for one minute.<br />Stir until chocolate is completely melted.<br />Add one group of the chocolate shards. Stir until melted and repeat with the other one.<br />Add in whatever appeals to you.<br />I used about 1/4 cup sun-dried mulberries, 1/4 cup chopped roasted cashews, and 1 1/2 cups organic brown rice crispies.<br /><br />Stir until everything is coated well.<br />Turn out onto a piece of aluminum foil or waxed paper, and spread out with the back of a wooden spoon.<br /><br />Let sit at room temperature until chocolate re-tempers, about 20 minutes."
5,fave,This is one of my favorite sauces to have handy. With this order you get two giant bottles which should last a while. The taste of this is perfect! Not for the faint of heart however...
1,Woodstream Gopher Trap 0610,This is a poor excuse for a gopher trap. I have lots of gophers and have used other traps. I recently bought 8 (four sets) of these traps. They are ill designed. The gophers are able to trip them without getting caught and have even managed to push the set trap out of the hole. The problem is the sweep of the pincers is too wide and the mechanism too easily clogged with sand or dirt. Don't bother with these traps.
5,These are good,"I ride Dualsport, so we go on pretty long rides, (100 mile+). I used to cramp up around 3 or 4 o'clock, but with this product, I tend to stay hydrated a lot better. Camelbak elixer is also good, as is any electrolyte mix. I highly recommend it!"
5,"Wonderful peppermint lifesavers.  Fresh, great value","Repeat buyer. They arrive securely packaged, quickly, very fresh. Probably the best peppermints ever<br />& these are nice large rolls."
5,Great tasting protein bars,These bars are great for people that have had gastric bypass surgery. Very good and they don't leave an after taste. I buy these all of the time now.
5,Wish it wasn't seasonal,"I'm a huge fan of the pumpkin spice coffee that's being sold at starbucks.  It gets expensive, my bestfriend told me that coffee mate was selling this so I gave it a try.  I'm very impressed by the quality and taste, the only down side is 5 grams of sugar for 1 tablespoon.  I recommend to any one reading this to buy it but go easy on the teaspoons."
5,MY FAVORITE TEA!,"i first tasted this in my school's cafe. Im crazy about everything in this tea! sage is on my favorite herb list and blackberry is on my favorite fruit list. The tea steeps pretty strong, and is flavorful enough to consume without sweetner. This is my favorite tea at the moment next to anything green tea or chamomile. good stuff!"
5,these pods fit the senseo holder and it's great Coffee!!!,I'm not a fan of Senseo brand coffee pods so I've been using espresso pods from Green Mountain (not great but way better then senseo) for some reason they quit making them so I was searching for pods that fit the Senseo after reading the review I took a shot in the dark and ordered a box of them from Amazon and fell in Love I use them with the espresso pod holder I got from amazon (not the single pod holder that comes stock)and have been enjoying the best espresso I've had in years.  I liked them so well I just ordered 2 more boxes
5,Bold and flavorful,"My husband likes his coffee dark and strong, but not too acidic.  I usually drink decaf, but occasionally have a cup of regular.  Of the many k-cup coffees we've tried, this is a favorite of both. Bold, with good aroma and smooth flavor.  Perfect for my husband on the smallest cup setting, and for me on the larger."
4,"Great taste, but lumpy","I love the flavor of all the Breadshops granolas, not just this one.<br />They go great in yogurt.<br />They do, however, tend to get very clumpy and I have to pound the<br />box on the edge of the table to break up the ""rocks"" before eating.<br />I've had this happen with three different flavors now."
2,"Good stuff, prohibitive shipping",Chocolates are great. Shipping costs are high. They took close to a week to actually ship the chocolates.
4,"My Senior Dog Won't Eat This, But My Puppy Loves It","Will puppies eat anything you put in front of them? Ours will--including shoes, cardboard boxes, electrical cords, and our clothing (not that we put these things in front of him; he tracks them down). We got Pedigree Little Champions Healthy Maturity Morsels in Sauce with Lamb & Rice because our senior dog, who is medium fussy, seems to like lamb and rice meaty loaf, but it's not always available. The morsels are small, but she still isn't interested. The puppy, on the other hand, seems to think that this stuff is the dog's bow-wow."
5,Tully's Italian Roast K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50),I received this order on time. I was late in getting this review out. I drank all the coffee already. I love the favor of the coffee.
4,Husband loves wife not so much,"My husband loves this coffee, he likes stronger coffee than I do. He says that it is very good and it must be so because he keeps on ordering it. I don't like it as much but only because I prefer a tad bit lighter brew. Amazon has the best price so far."
2,A so-so hot sauce,"For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Cholula Chili Lime Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I consider to be disappointing.  As far as I remember, I tried a bottle or two of this product in the past, but I do not remember having a favorable impression of it.  I decided to give this hot sauce another chance, but my opinion of it has not changed.  The heat is not a problem--neither is it too hot nor too mild.  But the flavor is bland.  The only things that stand out about this hot sauce are its tanginess and heat.  The bottle's wooden top is a nice touch, though.  Actually, I rate this hot sauce 2.5 stars."
2,Not impressive or memorable,I ordered this K-Cup coffee on the favorable reviews of others.  But  - taste is subjective and this particular flavor of coffee has not made any impression on me.  It's not horrible - it's simply average and it hasn't captured my attention.  Because of that --- when I finish the last pod --- I will not re-order it.
2,If you like the taste of artificial sweetner it is ok.,"I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself."
5,Very good orange spice tea.,"I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised. Now orange spice tea will always remind me of Hawaii. I bought a box of Bigelow Constant Comment, which is another orange spice tea, but it wasn't as good as Stash's, im my opinion. Stash has much more flavor, and isn't that the point?"
1,Fine,"Initially, I was not happy with this product. After contacting the vendor they remedied the problem and I am happy with it now."
5,GREAT TASTE & TEXTURE!,"I originally tried out this spaghetti with a manufacturer's coupon at my local supermarket -- and am hooked.  We now eat so much of this pasta that I plan to use Amazon's ""Subscribe & Save"" feature to save money on regular shipments.<br /><br />I am very picky about the taste and texture of my pasta.  The Barilla brand, and Barilla Spaghetti Plus Multigrain in particular, is a favorite -- it's delicious and always cooks up al dente.<br /><br />I admit that I am weak-willed when it comes to eating healthy if it requires sacrificing flavor and mouth-feel.  But I'm thrilled that I can enjoy this spaghetti without guilt. I even served it to dinner guests recently, when I normally would not consider using a ""healthy"" product. (I do care about the well-being of my friends -- but entertaining is often a special occasion that calls for pulling out the health-conscious stops.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />My only complaint is that Amazon.com's packaging has been inconsistent -- one shipment arrived in perfect condition, while another contained some squashed boxes due to inadequate cushioning."
5,Fits in Our Diabetic Diet if I Tweak the Recipe,"Both my husband and I come from a strong family history of type 2 diabetes. He was diagnosed 10 years ago and I was diagnosed a little over a month ago.<br /><br />When I made this pudding mix with skim milk, it spiked my husband's blood sugar so for a long time, we haven't had it. My husband has quite the sweet tooth and since he is very active and a normal weight, I decided to try making it with heavy cream instead. Skim milk has approximately 11.9 grams of carbs per cup and you need 2 cups to make this recipe. That's just too many carbs for us. Plus I know my husband and there's just no way he's going to limit himself to a half cup serving.<br /><br />The heavy cream I buy has no carbs. Instead of 2 cups of milk I replace it with half heavy whipping cream and half water and cook as directed on the package. It sets up just fine. My husband loves it and even when he eats half of it at a time, it doesn't spike his blood sugar. It hasn't affected his weight or his cholesterol levels either. I make it about twice a week or so.<br /><br />The downside: Adding heavy cream adds LOTS of calories to this pudding so if you are someone who has to watch fat/calories then this wouldn't work for you. I don't eat it because I only just got my blood sugar down to normal levels and I have more weight to lose so for now I'm leaving it out of my diet plan."
5,Name change,"This name was pretty embarrassing but they have now changed it to ""neuro passion"". just to let you all know :)"
5,Zukes treats,"My dog LOVES these treats whatever flavor they may be.  These are her favorites and very healthy too. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW"">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>"
5,yum!,I like these but if you eat too many (a whole pack) you may well feel a little worse for ware! It's hard to stop though...they are yummy!
5,Delicious!,Delicious! I ordered the french vanilla cappuccino because I was looking for something delicious that doesn't require the extra effort of adding cream and sugar. This is exactly that! I went through the 24 pack in 2-3 weeks and will definitely be ordering another box soon! I would recommend these for anyone that enjoys french vanilla flavor and normally adds cream and sugar to their coffee.
5,"Mild, but great, great aroma.","Have this handy when entertaining guests; great aroma.<br /><br />It is a milder coffee, perhaps perfect for those folks who don't want the strong coffee that most of us prefer, it seems, these days.<br /><br />It will not be my first choice for myself, but I will keep it on hand for guests. Very nice.<br /><br />By the way, all packages of Starbucks (when empty) entitle you to a free coffee at your local Starbucks. Practically cuts the price of a package of Starbucks coffee in half. Don't throw those empty packages away!"
5,Yummy snack for all ages,"These are great oatmeal cookies. I first found them in the full size bag, but I love these individual bags even more. They are easy to grab on the go. There's plenty in each bag. And they are so good, you'd have no idea they are wheat free!"
1,"Died, in spite of best efforts","I bought this from Amazon (not the seller depicted currently). The plant looked great on arrival, but it died with 15 days, despite trying very hard and following all instructions. I wonder if shipping in a box (and depriving light, etc for 2-4 days) causes such damage."
4,Quick Fix for the Broken Blender Problem,"I just got my Baby Brezza.  I was a little worried about the recent negative comments about the blades not dropping down into the 'blend' position after steaming.  Guess what?  Mine had the same problem. When I pressed 'Blend' I just got a high whining motor noise and no blender action.  Not willing to give up so easily and play the Returns game I removed the five or six screws from the bottom, popped the top off, and immediately saw the problem.  The problem is that the drive belt had slipped off the blender gear during transit, probably due to the way the Brezza is positioned in the box.  I pushed the drive belt back onto the gear, closed it up, and now the blender works fine.<br /><br />My only complaint now is that it doesn't really puree very well.  We ran a batch of carrots through it and it came out chunky.  There were even several dime-sized pieces that I guess had gotten between the blades and were not chopped up at all.  So like all food processors there is no escape from the 'open the top, scrape down the sides, and blend again' method if you want a true puree.  I did pop the chunky carrots into my mini Cuisinart and (after several scrape/blend cycles) got a fine puree.  One thing my Cuisinart has that the Baby Brezza doesn't is a 'Grind' option that basically runs the blades backwards so that they smash rather than slice.  I think this really helped break up the tiny chunks.  I wish the Brezza had the same."
4,Good Cold Shipping by Amazon,"No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free ""cold pack"".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality."
3,Picture larger than life,"The tower of sweets is beautifully packaged and is of good quality.  The only issue I have is that I thought it would be larger than what it was.  Still, when you compare candy pricing at a specialty store, this is an overall good product, and I will probably purchase again next Christmas."
5,Glad I found these again.,"I had not seen these candies in my neighborhood for a long time.  I developed a cough and nothing was working.  I tried to find these because I just had a feeling they would work.  I could not find them anywhere, so I searched Amazon, and viola, here they are.  They are a great candy and the drop of honey inside really soothes the throat.  My whole family loves them and everyone I offer them to try like them a lot.  I think Amazon will get a lot of new orders for these."
5,Sceptic won over,"You are receiving this from the world's biggest skeptic. My 13-year-old son convinced me to buy four of your Brain Toniq drinks at Wholefoods even though I told him it was a big joke to think a drink could make you focus any clearer or have any positive effect whatsoever. We each drank one of your drinks around 2:30 pm. I couldn not believe it--I felt clear headed, in a great mood all afternoon and evening. I felt ""sharp"" in two business meetings that afternoon and actually forgot I had taken one of the drinks. My 17-year-old son commented about my great mood and why was I so happy? It was then that it dawned on me that my day was no different than most, except for the Brain Toniq drink. My skeptism kicked in again. The drink could not be responsible for how I felt.<br /><br />So the next day I took another one of the drinks and again, same great mood, same happy feeling, same sharpness of thought and my entire family noticed. Wow! If anyone thinks this is just another marketing ploy or scam to get people to buy some kind of energy drink, forget it...this is the REAL deal. You have my permission to let anyone read my email to you or even inquire with me! Finally a company that actually delivers on their promise. Thank you so much! (By the way, we went back and cleaned out Wholefood's inventory, HA!)<br /><br />Ray Ramirez<br /><br />Highlands Ranch, Colorado"
5,Very Versatile,"Straight up it's a little tart, but still tastes good.  I got this for my joints, but I've found that it gives a lot of flavor to diet soda for a lot fewer calories (and more vitamins) than normal soda.  I also use it mixed with a little oil and vinegar for a great salad dressing.  It can also be mixed with a little balsamic vinegar for a delicious sauce for chicken or pork.  I can't tell you how many people have asked for my chicken recipe when I use it as an ingredient in a glaze while grilling.  And being a concentrate, it takes up a lot less space in comparison to buying several quarts worth of unconcentrated cherry juice.  This stuff is amazing!"
4,Fettuccini that is great with a whole lot less calories.,"Very happy with the product, quite unhappy with the shipping charges.  Will not purchase again until it can be bought locally."
5,Wonderful!,"These are the only brand of treats my cat will eat. She loves them! Prior to finding them on Amazon I would get them at local stores but it is so much cheaper to buy them through Amazon.<br />I always give my cat 4 or 5 treats every night before bed and sometimes during the day, so I can go through a bag of these pretty quick. For around $20 for 12-3oz packs is such a good deal, and the treats keep very well if you don't open them."
5,Dr Pepper Is The Only Indispensable Product,"It is vital, essential, imperative.  Necessary, requisite, required.  Fundamental, mandatory, compulsory.<br /><br />I love Dr Pepper.  I just wanted to let you know."
5,Awesome bread.,My kids were never thrilled at the idea of a sandwich until we started using this bread mix.  I use it in the bread machine and it's fluffy and tasty every time.  Nothing like the frozen rice bread options out there.
5,"Really, Really Delish!","These are awesome pretzels, with a rich pumpernickel flavor and a aftertaste/hint of onion. They're great alone or with a dip; I even served them with soup. The six-bag package is better than the old 12-bag version, because the last couple of bags aren't hanging around too long. These will continue to be a regular purchase."
5,An afternoon pick-me-up.,Delicious and effective stimulant although a bit too expensive to develop a serious habit.  The best of the LOTTE gums in my opinion.
1,"not very nice pineapple tasted better without the powder i rekon i could make i better powder with sugar, salt and flavour","i rekon i could make i better powder with sugar, salt and flavours out off the shelf from the local super market. tho item was well packed and turned up at mt door faster than i thought it would. just not my taste"
4,Good food - yum!  Woof.,"My dog likes the Canidae, and he's very fussy.  The fish product is a little, well, fishy, but the other varieties are solid."
5,"At last, Belly flops online!","Finally, no more begging my niece in California to send me my Belly Flops!  I do wish there were more strawberry-flavored Flops; but the assortment is plenty varied, and I love 'em.  Thanks for making these yummy treats available online, J.B.!"
4,Great product for dogs that can handle the high protein,"In short, our experience has been that this is awesome food for adult years.<br />Two dogs:<br />Male GSD on Core from five years old to 10-1/2 years old.<br />Female Rottie, On a mix of 1ea 26lbs bag Core and 1ea 35lbs bag Canidae All Life Stages formula  at five years old, still on it at seven years old.<br /><br />All dogs are different, so your results may vary.<br /><br />Took a bit more than 9 days for a smooth transition for the GSD, with a bit of loose stool during the transition (off Purina One).<br />The Rottie, had no problems, and made the switch in an easy 7 days.<br />For the GSD senior years, it is too much protein.<br />GSD eats about 2.5 cups a day.<br />Rottie eats over 4 cups a day.<br /><br />Fed Super-Mutt (the GSD) on this for about 7 years, until he was 10-1/2.  He did great on it for all that time.  Great coat, firm stool, easy to maintain weight, and great blood tests at his yearly check-ups.  We were extremely active, with daily runs and walks, play at the park, etc. But digestibility was always a bit on the low side. If I cut the volume of food down, he would loose weight before any noticeable decrease in stool size.<br />I could also use the kibble for training, as he really liked the flavor.<br /><br />My Girl Friend's Rottie is on a mix of this with Canidae All Life Stages.  She is a high drive, work-aholic! Honest, you would be hard pressed to find a more active dog.  She does amazingly well on this.  Stunningly beautiful coat, great digestibility, easily maintained weight.  She has been on this mix for about 2 years now, and she is seven.  No kidney issues with high protein, but we will watch as she ages. Her focus, and attention seems more rock solid too on this mix...<br /><br />At Super-Mutts yearly check-up (when he was 10-1/2) we noticed kidney functions were out of whack.  So as a test I switched him to a senior food (Chicken Soup for the Soul), this is much lower protein.  This change brought his kidney functions back to normal, and digestibility is better.  So he is enjoying his senior years on ""senior food"".<br />Hth,"
5,Yummy and addictive,"Once you open the box, you can barely stop yourself from finishing the whole package.<br />Goes well for afternoon snacks."
5,what a treat!,Gardeners love anything related to their gardens and when I had a group over I served these hibiscus flowers in champagne or soda.  They raved!  You can use any beverage that is sparkling and you'll get a wonderful presentation.  I can't wait to try another recipe using the flowers and the syrup...
5,For when you forget the actual bacon,This is a great tasting product!! Both me and my wife love it. I don't know how they did it but it is wonderful.
5,Great Tasting Chips,"After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon."
5,YUMMY AND FRESH,"Definitely would order again.  Each time I get it, it is fresh.  If you like licorice, you will like this mix."
5,Yummy!,"I tried other brands and they were comparable to the non-gluten brands that you would find on sale.  But when I tried this brand, I was pleasantly suprised.  It was cheesy (no punn intended) and creamy.  I will definately buy again."
5,Great taste,"I gave half of the 6 pack to my friend visiting from Tokyo. We both love them. Although, it would be nice if they came in bigger cans."
5,You just gotta try these!!!,"Eating something that's super delicious & decadent plus nutritionally dense! What a treat! You can pop them anytime, they're very satisfying. You feel like you're cheating, but you're not at all! I must confess they're highly addictive. A nice cup of tea or decaf or a cold glass of almond milk are great accompaniments. Their ORAC content is through the roof, though their Green Chocolate Dream variety is even more so. Amazon presents a great deal for this 3 pack, wish they carried the same offer for all of their varieties, and there are numerous. All just as awesome."
4,Very good popocorn,"My doctor told me I must eat ""hulless"" popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I can't give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore."
5,Smooth & delicious rooibos,"I can't have caffeine, so rooibos is the closest I can get to black tea without the buzz. This is a very mild but flavorful rooibos that is good plain or with sugar & milk/cream. I try to have a cup everyday. Good stuff!"
3,Just Okay,"This babyfood pretty much tastes like applesauce.  I am so tired of things being labeled as something else being mostly applesauce!  It's good for on the go, but if you're not careful, it will make a mess.  Don't accidentally hit it or let baby squeeze it too hard!"
5,This is excellent tuna!,"I use a lot of tuna, so I'm always looking for a great product at a great price.<br /><br />This is it!<br /><br />It has a long shelf-life, too. (Another brand of tuna I bought as a case lot came with an expiration date of this year; fortunately, I managed to use it up.)<br /><br />I hope the Polar tuna continues to be available."
5,best tasting protein yet,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:35 Mins<br /><br /></span>"
5,Great Popcorn!!,This is the best tasting popcorn that I have ever tried.  I personally believe it is better than the popcorn served at most theaters.  The packages are easy to use and provide a no-mess solution to popcorn machines.
5,"Finally, a big container","My wife uses a lot of Tarragon in her cooking. I've been purchasing .5 oz bottles at our local grocery for over $5/bottle. I finally engaged my brain and searched on Amazon. I got 7oz here for the cost of less than 2.5oz from my local grocer. How about quality? My wife is very happy with the product, and I'm happy with the food she prepares with it...so it's a win/win.<br /><br />It's a lot of Tarragon at a great price."
2,more like 5 minutes of energy,"I drive a lot and frequently suffer drowsiness on the road. I was hoping this product would be the answer. Unfortunately, it  was not. The effect I feel after downing a bottle is marginal. Maybe a boost in alertness for a few minutes but quickly back to the same level of drowsiness I was at. Two bottles does not help much either.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it seems to work so well with others but I wish I had the same effects. I am 6 foot 2 inches and around 250 lbs. Not sure if it works well only with smaller individuals.<br /><br />Despite not working so well for me, I still take it occasionally on the road for the small effect it does offer - though I do wonder if it's more placebo effect than anything."
5,Great buy in bulk,A member of my family chews gum all the time.  Purchasing in bulk has eliminated the weekly trip to the store to purchase gum.  The cost is about the same but the convenience is worth it.
5,floorentine panettone,"this product has good cosistancy of fiber formula, well balanced seasonings distributed throughout, smooth flavor in each bite and very compatable with any entree."
5,Great cereal from Kelloggs!,"This is very tasty cereal from Kelloggs, it is also nutritious to boot.  Even though Special K products are targeted more from women, I am a guy and love this cereal. It's also great straight out of the box as a tasty snack!"
4,Decent Deal,"I think BJs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by Gerber, but if your child really loves peaches, this is great!"
5,dried peanutbutter,"fantastic product, I may never buy regular peanutbutter again, very low calories, taste just like the regular product, easy to use in smoothies"
5,So fragrant!,"These beans were shipped super fast and arrived well in advance of the anticipated date!  I used these to make several bottles of homemade vanilla for holiday gifts  and, so far, the smell is divine!  Lastly, I just want to add that the customer service was fantastic - prompt emails regarding the order status and they included a great coupon for the next order!  I will definitely be using this company again."
5,Part of my lessening plan,"These drinks are part of my plan to drop the cost of having lunch, and drop a few pounds off of my body.  These do have the spicy aftertaste of stevia which I kind of like.  At $2.67 each, I save money over the burger and death sticks(fries)lunch.<br />I enjoy the taste of each flavor with cappuccino being my favorite.  I have lost enough weight and am satisfied enough to sign up for the subscription.  Two to three times a week my work day diet consists of two pieces of fruit, one of these protein drinks and a handful of almonds.  At lunch I take to the park one of these drinks, a piece of fruit and a large bottle of water. I go back to work satisfied.  I have enjoyed these enough that I have not even tried Orgain meal replacement drink like I was planning to.<br /><br />This review is for: CalNaturale svelte Sustained Energy Protein Drink, Variety Pack, 15.9- Ounce Aseptic Boxes (Pack of 12)"
4,"fresher...well,yeah","of course if you package snack in smaller packaging vs big bags it'll stay fresh longer.not sure if the extra packing drives up the cost more or not;daycare providers might be better off with the full wrapped stacks, but these are good for lunch bags and dieters."
5,great coffee,good to the last drop. my wife drink it all in about 1-1/2 weeks(pack of 2) thats 48 k-cups. i guess it was good.<br />i guess i will get more.
2,not as good as orthene,not as good as orthene - was not very good in effectively killing  aphids and Japanese beetles.  Also did a poor jobs on trips.
5,Dove Men Body Wash,"Finally a Body Wash for a Man.  This bottle opens from the bottom and only comes out when the bottle is squeezed.  Lathers up quickly and leaves a clean feeling on skin. Not harsh on or drying of skin.  Rinses off easy, does not have a soapy film feeling that's left behind after rinsing off.  Leaves a light clean scent, not offensive or girly smelling.  Skin does feel healthier after about a week of use.  Safe to use all over including on sensitive dry skin.  My son (10) uses it as well, he wants to have his own bottle. :)  Since your skin is your largest organ, makes sense that you keep it healthy.  Women have been doing it for years.  Makes sense that a product like Dove Men + Care is geared towards a mans skin care needs.  Great Product!!! A+"
5,Newman's Coffee K-Cup,I'm a fan of Newman's Products for the company's contributions to charity.  The taste of this blend is perfect for me and I recommend it to someone who enjoys a nice-bodied decaf.
5,yummy for your tummy,"The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips."
5,"Great taste, winning idea",Each tea bag comes in its own individual baggie so you don't have to worry about tasting the bitter loose tea leaves in your tea. It's a great idea and one that hopefully catches on. The aroma and flavorful taste is also quite smooth and not too strong.
3,Pretty -- but...,"These are really pretty.  The candy itself is small, approximately 2 inches wide, and the stick is very long.  They look very nice arranged in a vase at a party.<br /><br />That said, they really don't taste very good.  Out of 40 adults and their children, no one cared for the flavor. I don't know of one person that managed to eat the whole candy, even though it was small."
5,Rishi Silver Needle Tea,"The reasons that this is my favorite tea:<br /><br />(1) Extremely fragrant, high quality silver needle sort<br />(2) Very mild yet distinct taste<br />(3) This tea is loaded with anti-oxidants<br />(4) I rarely get sick anymore ever since I started drinking a big cup of this tea once daily"
5,Fresher than canisters,"The advantage of the sticks over the canisters is the freshness remains!  I just use scissors to open the sticks, it is mess-free.  I add one stick to my pot of coffee to add a hint of smooth flavor."
1,Unhealthy ingredients for a healthy drink,"I love my SodaStream seltzer maker.  I purchased the syrup mixes to give my drinks a little flavor.  I was very disappointed with the ingredient list: artificial flavors, sodium benzoate, acesulfame potassium, and Red #40 and Yellow #6.<br /><br />I drink seltzer instead of soda because I want to avoid these artificial ingredients.  These syrup mixes were not worth the money."
4,Gnuts!,"These are great, healthy, grab and go packs of nuts.  I'm a almond and pecan fan; these are a lot woodier or nuttier than I'm used to, and a little dry.  However, it's good to mix it up every once in a while.  These are about twice the size of a ""100 calorie pack"".  The variety inside each pack is ok, seems a little peanut and hazelnut heavy though.  I'm glad I tried this, but will not be purchasing again.  I'm going for the 100 calorie almond packs instead.  Good packaging, great to grab and go, just not my cup of tea."
5,Fabulous!,"If you are looking for a natural, non-sugar/ high frutose corn syrup product, look no further.  This is sweeter than sugar so you use much less AND you don't get that 'sugar high' that makes you shaky hours later.  Terrific flavor- can't wait to try the others!"
5,Yeast storage,Great product to store washed yeast.  These stand up on their own and are a much better solution than plastic.  Since it's glass I am able to boil and sanitize the vials before yeast storage.  And they take up a lot less space in the fridge than mason jars.
1,5 STARS TO 4,"MY 10 YEAR OLD LAB LOVED THAT FIRST CASE....THEN SHE STOPPED EATING ALL FOOD FOR WEEKS. SHE WOULD NOT EVEN EAT PEOPLE FOOD LIKE EGGS, CHICKEN THAT THE VET SAID TO TRY...REALLY STRANGE SITUATION THAT WENT ON FOR 4-5 WEEKS....I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER  OUT WHAT SHE SURVIVED ON ALL THOSE WEEKS.....AFTER THE VET CHECKED HER OUT AND SHE RECOVERED FROM THIS STLLL ""MYSTERY ILLNESS"", I THOUGHT FOR SURE SHE'D BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE THIS AGAIN.....BUT NO WAY...SHE WON'T TOUCH NEWMAN'S ORGANIC GRAIN FREE CAN FOOD TO THIS DAY, EVEN TRIED A DIFFERENT FLAVOR.  SHE WALKS RIGHT OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN I OFFER IT TO HER. I FEEL BAD, BECAUSE I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH ON HER FOOD AND WANTED TO GIVE HER A LITTLE CAN WITH HER DRY.  ANY BODY HAVE ANY SIMILAR EXPERIENCES????"
5,A Fantastic Bar!!!!,I am a health and fitness nut and I've tried about everything out there.  I love these bars as they are really filling and taste great (unless you are a sugar addict and need everything to have that super sweet calorie filling flavor!)  I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.
5,Rave reviews from my Airedales!!,"A few months ago we adopted two adult Airedales.  They had been pretty neglected and were overweight.  Both frequently limped when they walked and neither would run and play.  The female groaned every time she had to get to her feet.  They were lethargic and had been fed a supermarket brand dry food.  We immediately switched to Blue Buffalo Adult Fish and Sweet Potato food - they absolutely love it.  Both have lost weight and the change in their energy level is remarkable.  I'm a believer!  I can't recommend this food highly enough.  The Blue Buffalo cookies are a real favorite around here, too."
5,An old favorite and I'll give some ideas for it,"Back in the day, I used to just eat these right out of the tin.  I've always loved clams in any form.  Same is true for smoked foods.  You can't beat the combination of flavors.  But let me toss a couple ideas at you:<br /><br />1) Get the big scoop sized Fritos, add a blob of cream cheese and one of the clams.  Repeat until you fill a tray.  Easy hors'dourves!<br /><br />2) Big sushi rolls.  Add strips of cream cheese, the clams and some chopped green onion.  Yum!"
4,Convenient way to cook it...,"This oatmeal is very good, no doubt, but I don't buy it here at Amazon because the price is too high.  It is $4.99 a can at Whole Foods.  If your price is higher than Whole Foods, you know you need to revisit it!<br /><br />But, there is something available at Amazon that will make cooking the oatmeal a breeze, especially on weekdays, this little, Proctor Silex 1.5 quart slow cooker!  There are several different sources for it here on Amazon.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CA3C6"">Proctor Silex 33015 1.5-Quart Round Slow Cooker</a><br /><br />I think this is the best very small pot because it has more than one temp setting and runs true to temp.<br /><br />Put 1 cup of the steel cut oats + 4 cups of water in the crock, set it to ""low"" and go to bed.  When you wake up, you'll have perfectly cooked oatmeal without standing over the stove.  It makes between 2-4 servings depending on how much oatmeal you can eat at a sitting!  We get 4 out of it with two grownups and to kids. Another plus is that you can keep the oatmeal warm in this pot for quite a while, accommodating a family where everyone doesn't get up at the same time."
5,honey ginger tea,"this tea, is not just like any other tea, and its pretty hard to find too...<br />best ginger tea ever, is good for detox and stomachaches . got it pretty fast too, and was as described. thanks."
5,SMOKEHOUSE HAS THE HIGHEST QUALITY DOG TREATS - ALL 3 OF OUR DOGS LOVE THEM !!,WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH ALL THE SMOKEHOUSE DOG TREATS - WE HAVE TRIED SEVERAL AND THEY ARE VERY HIGH QUALITY AND OUR DOGS REALLY LOVE ALL OF THEM!!  WE HAVE FOUND QUALITY - HEALTHY TREATS FOR OUR DOGS - THANKS SMOKEHOUSE !!!
5,Fantastic!,"This couscous is absolutely wonderful. The couscous is large pearl and is delicious served hot or cold.  Cooks beautifully -- delicious plain with mushrooms, mint or any one of a dozen other additions. Highly recommend it."
5,This is THE BOMB on Salmon!!,"All you need to make THE BEST SALMON is to sprinkle a little of this on one side of the salmon, and bake/broil the requisite time.  In my infrared toaster oven (which cooks faster than most traditional ones... you may have to up to double the time in those),  I simply put some aluminum foil on the small tray, lay the salmon fillets down on that, sprinkle a little Zatarains Creole seasoning on the top, then put it in on 425 for about 10 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!!  And incredibly easy!!<br /><br />I've tried other Creole seasonings to make Salmon, and the two I've tried didn't even come close.<br /><br />AND, salmon is pretty forgiving, so if you overcook it a bit, no big deal, it'll still be good.<br /><br />Try it, you'll be so thankful you did, and will not bother with all the hassle of mixing special sauces for your salmon.  When I go out to a restaurant, I rarely ever order the salmon, because I regularly make better (almost always) at home for a lot less money."
5,None compares,"Once you have had this oatmeal, you won't want to go back to any other. Highly recommend this."
5,"Not Noodles, but Super Close","I love pasta, plain and simple. But since pasta doesn't love me, I need to lose weight. Lo and behold, I stumbled across these beauties. They take some work (seriously, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! I'll bet half of the bad reviews are because they didn't follow the directions), but are worth it. They hold sauce well and really let the flavors of the sauce shine through. They do lack that slightly-sweet starchy taste that pasta has, but, hey, I didn't expect them to be perfect. Also, texture-wise, they aren't quite the same. They remind me of slightly under cooked noodles, soft on the outside, chewy on the inside. I saw someone describe the texture as ""cartilage"" like, and I think he/she hit it on the nose. If you can follow the directions, I say give 'em a try."
5,My Yorkie can spend hours playing with the Tug-A-Jug!,I bought the Tug-A-Jug for my Yorkie and he loves to push and pull it around the room while it pops treats out. He can spend hours just playing with it. My Golden Retriever even plays with the Tug-A-Jug. I'd recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that needs a challenge and loves the mental stimulation that this product provides.
4,Flying High!,"I just recieved my Jet Fuel this morning and here are my first impressions after just a couple of cups:<br />Flavor is smooth, not bitter (maybe just a hint of aftertaste), deep and satisfying. That being said, I'll probably go back to my Keurig ""Green Mountain"" coffee next time anyway. I do like the Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging (about 36 cents per cup on the auto re-order program!). I cut the box open like a giant dispenser and put it in the cupboard above the coffee maker. Convenience is what it's all about, baby! (I expect at least a $10K reward for the idea, Keurig.)"
5,Laxmi's Delights Golden Flaxseed Spread with Dates & Orange,"This stuff is GREAT, especially with peanut butter. Tasty, tangy, and good for you.  My sister just tried it and wants some herself, so I'm sending part of my order to her.  ""Delights"" is appropriately named, for sure.  Now I'm going to try the Lemony Flaxseed Spread with Ginger and Honey.  I'm sure it will be just as good."
5,Health Food Magic,"This is a great organic, tasty snack food.  Just enough crunch to satisfy the munchies!  Something this good for you and tastes great ... what more can you ask for???"
5,baby loves it!,this was recommended to me by my girlfriend and my baby boy loves it!  we skipped the rice cereal and went right to oatmeal when it was time for solids.  great product!
5,"great product, great price, pepermint is outstanding",Love this brand. Great price with save and subscribe. My husband loves them. Top with whipped cream in a can and I have a happy man. I wish you could buy all pepermint cocoa.
5,delicious,"I live in a remote area and my local grocers stopped selling chinese resteraunt tea. I had been looking for a while, then I read online that oolong tea is supposed to help with weight loss. I cannot vouch for this but it does speed up the metabolism, and tastes just like the tea from a chinese food place that you love, so you can have some with your delivery food or p.f. changs from the freezer, delish"
5,Good Stuff,"Excellent food - just a nice natural mix of grain, nuts, and fruit.  One of my staples. I mix it with another naturally sweetened Kashi cereal (Honey Puffs).  Arrived as advertised - no problems. Good price."
1,bad taste,"Coffee was burnt, had a bad aftertaste, and very acidic.  note sure if a bad batch but this was not good coffee."
5,Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers,"Like a rocket ready for take off you are on the launching pad ready to blast off and take charge; this cup is not for the squeamish, it has a extra bold in you face taste with a robust after taste. If you are ready to meet your day and take off to new adventures Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers is your cup."
5,convenient and tasty,I love the pod idea...makes cleaning so much easier. This is perfect for a quick shot of espresso after dinner. Excellent!
3,get the pills if you feed your dog dry dog food,"I can't tell if this works or not, so I'm giving it three stars for the fact that I have to review it, but it's the wrong type to feed my dog who eats dry dog food. It doesn't cling, it falls to the bottom of the bowl and she picks through her food as she's an oldie and nibbles at her food. I could switch to wet food to get her to eat it, but I'm just going to go back to the pills. The glucosamine pills and the doggy cox2 inhibitor she takes have changed her life. She's old, so that's saying something. If you feed your dog canned/wet food this might be a good choice, but if it's dry food and they don't wolf it down, it defeats the purpose. Wish I could say more.But my final thought on this is that something in the product description should recommend this for wet dog food."
5,"Finally, A Packaged Home-Made Cookie","These must be new, I'd never seen them.  Sounded worth a try.  I'll be trying more.  Pricey? Not really, for this kind of cookie.  And these are individually wrapped, thus keeping each cookie fresh, not to mention that it won't so easily leave crumbs in your pocket.<br /><br />My first taste was memorable.  I think it was the cinnamon that gave it a ""different"" touch.  Probably about the best tasting oatmeal-raisin cookie I've had.  Thick, soft and delectable.<br /><br />Yep, I'll be ordering more."
5,The only nut thin flavor that is dairy-free!,"My favorite flavor because it is also dairy free, and even though they are not as strongly flavored, they are DELICIOUS with hummus! This is my favorite gluten-free snack."
5,Best Dog Treats,"These liver chunks are like crack for dogs. The niblets are magic for training dogs because the critters will do anything for these. Although freeze-dried liver is pricey, you can cut the chunks into tiny chinks and use while training, rewarding, or just saying, 'I love you, my good dog.'"
5,"A good coffee, and a great buy..............","I was familiar with the Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups, but couple that with the ""subscribe and save"" option, and you have an outstanding combination!"
5,my preferred sweetener,"I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way."
4,Good seasoning,"I like these limes. Since they are VERY hard I crushed them in the mortar and then made a fine powder with them in the blender. I then mixed in some sea salt and use it in soups, on meat and with hard boiled eggs and stuff. Great stuff!"
4,"Good, I'd definitely buy this!","I like the flavor of this and it's nice that there are some vitamins in it, too.  This brand is better than the MIO in my opinion, you have to use much less of it to get a good flavor.  My only issue with it is that it says a squeeze will flavor your water perfectly.  Uh, no.  A squeeze of it puts so much of the flavor enhancer into the water that it almost burns my throat.  It's perfect when I actually measured out the ounces, a full ounce for a bottle of 19 oz of water was perfect.  I used the little medicine cups that come with baby medicine to measure it.  LOL"
5,Love! Love! Love!,"I can't say enough about Orgain! It is by far the best meal replacement/protein shake I have tried (and I've tried them all). My husband and I each have at least one per day, for breakfast and occasionally after a workout.  I have purchased Orgain on ""subscribe and save"" for several months, and have encouraged many others to do so as well.  They are delicious and convenient. Thank you Orgain for delivering a superior product at a great price!"
5,Win Win,"These are delicious, low calorie, you can read all the ingredients, they're cheap compared to similar products and they show up on time. What more can be said?"
5,Taste just like Chocolate Chip Cookies!,First off let me say that I've been a fan of Clif bars for a while now. So I saw these at my local grocery store and decided to give them a whirl.<br /><br />WOW! Just wow! These take exactly like crunchy chocolate chip cookies. They are absolutely delicious. I find myself craving these now instead of brownies or a candy bar. I was actually eating them in class one day and a few people tried them and now are also obsessed. Great product and completely yummy!
5,The snack you can eat without ruining your diet,"The snack you can eat without ruining your diet. I find 13 chips to be a perfect snack, strong in flavour, low in fat and calories. This amount also makes the bag last longer. Yes I would buy them again, no I will not recommend them, they are all mine, mine ,mine!"
4,Instand tea with a gingery bite,"This tea comes in individual packets. It's kind of crystalized, not exactly powdered, but it dissolves quickly and easily. It has a very strong ginger bite to it to please those of you that are disappointed with the weak ginger taste of ginger ale and some ginger beers. I love ginger and enjoyed this tea immensely. It was flavorful without adding sweetener or lemon."
5,THE BEST ENERGY FOOD BAR & IT'S RAW!,"Lara Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cashew Cookie, is the most delicious food bar I have ever tasted.  Besides being so yummy, I love the fact that it's RAW and therefore all the nutrition from the dates and cashews is kept intact.<br /><br />I always keep extra bars in my car or purse so that these tasty bars are always available to satisfy my hunger wherever I go.  One bar will keep me going for one to two hours, which is a blessing when I can't eat a regular meal."
5,BEST ever!,"This is the BEST sauce ever!  For some reason, my local health food store discontinued it, so very glad to find it here. Tried many others. No comparison. Freshest, most tomatoey taste. I'd rather have this than dessert!  :)"
5,My favorite variety pack of Tully's coffee,I love Tully's coffee and this is the best variety pack!! It has a nice variety.  They're exactly what I need to get going in the morning or as a pick me up in the afternoon.
5,Orgain tastes amazing....,"I had been drinking the Myroplex Lite and after reading all the nasty ingredients on it and not liking the aftertaste, I  switched over to Orgains.  No aftertaste...nothing but natural ingredients and no artificial sweeteners.  Love the creamy chocolate fudge and set up for automatic deliveries...My brother gave me  the  vanilla bean flavor to try the other day but I personally thought it was ""chalky"".  Orgains is so much better for you than the other artificial protein drinks out there!!"
3,pretty packaging but not delicious,The presentation is impressive and will get the recipients attention.  If you are looking for a great flavored tea collection.  Look elsewhere.
5,Popchips for Weightwatchers,"Here is a nutritional breakdown:<br /><br />Calories: 100<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g<br />Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Poly and Mono: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 160mg - 7%<br />Potassium 180mg - 5%<br />Total Carbohydrates 15g - 5%<br />Dietary Fiber 1g - 4%<br />Sugars 2g - 4%<br />Protein 1g<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 2%<br /><br />For Weightwatcher folks this breaksdown to 2 Points......."
5,great tasting superfood snack,"I'm gluten free and on the go. Grabbing this on my way in or out is a quick and easy way to ease hunger or cravings.  And it is so good for you, too!"
1,Doesn't work for the average person,I bought different varieties of these herb gardens in a bag for Christmas gifts. At least three different people told me a few months later that they diligently took care of it and nothing grew. I felt so bad! I'd steer clear.
5,thank you dr lucy!,"these are so great for a GF kid (or adult...) and for the whole family! we're hooked on the chocolate chip, but we like the oatmeal and cinnamon a lot too. and its great that they come in individual packs or full-sized cookies.  pretty healthy and all-natural ingredients, what could be wrong? they're great, we recommend them!"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"Of all the varieties of K-cups I have tried, I can say this has been the worst.  Don't waste your money.  It does not taste anything like real hot cocoa and I did not detect any milk chocolate flavor.  The Swiss Miss are a considerably superior product, although still your making it with water so it will never taste as good as home made."
5,Best Cheese around,"I have found this cheese hard to find in most grocery stores. Shelf space being taken up by store namesd products. I was happy to find it at Amazon, quick delivery and a price point comparible with store prices. The cheese is wonderful with Nachos and cooking. We enjoy it very much. Thanks Amazon"
5,Surprisingly good!,I was lucky to be given a sample of this matcha by a friend. Its very good - so good it is now sitting in my cart ready for purchase later this evening as I have more looking around to do.<br />It tastes like fresh oranges! I can't stop thinking about it ever since I sampled it about a week ago it has been on my mind!<br />Really good mixed with peach although I prefer the orange over the peach as a stand alone matcha - very good combined - like a fuzzy navel! :)
5,outstanding!!!,I had a taco party and almsot every single guest asked me How do I make the Corncake?.  I run out every year.
5,Healthy Treats,"I have been giving my dog these treats since she has been a puppy.  She loves them and were great rewards for her training.  Best of all, they have kept her teeth and gums clean and free of plaque.  I recommend them to all dog owners.  Buying them from Amazon on a recurring basis has been a lifesaver.  These treats do not last long on store shelves so finding them locally has been difficult.  Thanks Amazon for solving my source problem!"
3,udon,This is a famous japanese grocery.<br /><br />I like this one because it is very derisious.<br /><br />You should buy this item.
5,excellent and delicious,"this rice is so good. it's better than I could ever cook, even in a rice maker. it's moist and delicious. it heats up in 1 min 30 sec. it's a good quantity. i put a little soy sauce and sesame seed on it and it's a meal."
5,Multiple Orders--Great Value,"I've ordered Manitoba Hemp Hearts 5#s several times and each time I've been very pleased with the quality of the product.  I have not experienced any ""hulls"" as some have complained of and I use it every day.  This is a very healthy and tasty product that I'll always eat.  It's a great ""emergency"" food as well and can sustain human life as it is really a perfect food.  I love the taste.  I highly recommend this product."
1,Not  so tasty cheese rounds,"I did not find the cheese rounds, honey dijon to be very tasty at all. In fact, I could not even eat one bag.  I would not recommend them to anyone."
3,"Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing, Fat-Free Original, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)",The only problem is the expiration date being to close to the purchase so only if you own a restaurant or have a big family to share with I don't recommend buying this product.
2,Bland,"I bought this after a fellow tea snob suggested it.  I wish I hadn't!  This is the first product made by Republic of Tea I have not loved.  The flavor is far weaker than their other teas.  I recommend getting your chocolate fix elsewhere.  If you are simply looking for the buzz that mate can bring, there are cheaper options out there."
3,Too many decaf!,"I did like the selection of coffee so I could sample a large assortment without buying a large box and being stuck with somethign I don't like.  However, negative - out of 35 cups, 11 were decaf.  That's 1/3!  I don't drink decaf...who does anyways?  I drink coffee to WAKE UP.  Will not purchase again, and do not recommend."
3,"Great Price, Not Healthy","If you are a fan of Slim Jim, buying this package is perfect. Each Slim Jim is packed in a small, snack sized plastic wrap and the price is really great for the 100 Slim Jims this package offers. With that said, this is not the most healthy product...think, sodium, preservatives, fat, and the list goes on...If you are okay with the health factor though, this package is great."
1,Unfortunately it's junk food for dogs,"I normally feed my dog a premium dog food where for his weight and age, I feed him about 2.5 cups a day and he is healthy and maintains his weight (lab/border collie mix). According to Purina and this product, I would need to feed my dog  6 cups of this dog food based on his weight. Just makes you go through the product faster and empty your wallet more often. Disappointing."
5,Best BBQ sauce EVER!,"I am a former Cincinnatian, so some of my love of this BBQ sauce is based a bit on nostalgia (like the Skyline Chili!).  Even so, I do believe this is the best BBQ sauce I've had and I frequently order it for myself and friends."
5,coconut crazy,"Love this drink for hydrating following a workout. Quenches my thirst like nothing other. I've tried other brands of Coconut H2O, and nothing tastes quite as smooth as this."
3,Aussi Licorce made in the USA,"Does not seem as soft or as intense with flavor as the black licorce. However,some guest and friends prefer it over the black.Quite different than the traditional Strawberry---seems to have more of a multi-berry/cherry flavor to it.."
4,It's canned coffee at its best,"I don't mean to be nasty, really! Giving the product 4 stars proves that. It's convenient and if you are a confirmed caffeine addict, having one of these in your car will save the day. It's preferable by far to an over-percolated cup of joe made from stale ground beans. But it is a far cry from a well-pulled shot. If you know what you're getting and that is acceptable, I recommend this over the Starbucks Double Shot (similar product) for the following reasons: it's not as sweet, it seems lighter and less thickened by gums or fillers, and Illy beans are consistent and good if you like a dark roast. You can taste the evaporated milk, but some people enjoy that. People seem to like working for Starbucks, but remember what life was like before there was one on every street corner? Buck the trend, and try this Illy drink!"
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,My local stores use to carry this product and my daughter must have it everyday on waffles - thank you for carrying this so I won't disappoint.
2,"If you want a flavored coffee, okay... but otherwise YUK",Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.<br /><br />I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk.
2,Just blah...,"It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought I'd give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!"
5,found the winner!,"Ok i have been through several dog food brands (all high end holistic fancy stuff)and have been through some ruff (lol) times finding just what works perfect for my  female Rhodesian Ridgeback. Now i wont bash any brands as some seem to do because some food seems to work with one pup and not another so dont be a jerk and think some food is crap because it didn't work out for your dog, be a good owner and look for things they like and react well to :-)..... now that being said i had a neurotic on edge dog with huge shedding issues and RR's don't shed. This food was like the miracle cure and after a year of my poor little girl trying different foods all she gets is complements on how great she looks from strangers as we walk the streets. if your used to high end prices this food is also a value seeing that you get 44#'s which does make a difference trust me. so as for us its a full five star no shedding, great coat, healthy mind and a value! don't be afraid try this if others arnt working out for your dog or even if you want your puppy to look even better."
5,nice  product,This is a really great tasting coconut water.<br />i prefer the flavored compared to regular and<br />this is a real sweet treat.<br />I also love the bottle because it is easy<br />to take with you.
5,"Tasty, with added benefits!","My 9 year old cat can be a bit of a picky eater. I wanted to try some different treats that didn't have the loaded by-product most anything made for pets seems to have. The thing I like most about these is they're not just treats, they can be used to supplement or even replace your cat food. A little pricey to replace considering my cat gets 1/2 cup of food a day, but not a bad thing to have around when the stores run out of your grain-free food."
5,Chocolate Covered Cherries,I absolutely love these chocolate covered cherries.  They are always fresh and the quality is outstanding.
1,Damaged cans,"Cans were badly dented making opening them very difficult, labels were damaged or completely off of cans, and the product was too ""soupy"". Koko refused to eat it. Not what was expected from a Newman product."
5,Love it!,"I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix. She's about 42 lbs now. This food is magic!! I love it! She's never been ""food motivated"" and so she's always been a little reluctant to eat her kibble, but she honestly LIKES this stuff. She'll do tricks for it like it is a treat. More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend.<br /><br />We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen.<br /><br />Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients. From what I've read, they get rice from California and Lamb from New Zealand, but otherwise -- everything comes from farms in and around Alberta. No food recalls on this brand!<br /><br />One word of advice: like with all good dog foods, it's best to keep the bag tightly closed. It goes stale."
4,Refreshing summer beverage,"I purchased this item when it was on sale.  I wasn't certain if I'd like it but I've read so much about the health benefits of green tea I wanted to try it.  This is a nice, pleasant beverage. The flavor isn't too strong.  I add a packet of Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  The powder dissolves easily in cold water.  The flavor is natural not fake.  I was impressed enough with it that I have signed up for auto-delivery."
5,espresso supremo,This powder is great for adding a mocha flavor to baked goods. It is easy to work with too.
2,Not Impressed AT ALL,"Im a fan of Medjool dates - I love dates. After looking at reviews from this product I decided to buy the dates. I was NOT impressed at ALL with this batch of dates. They were hard outside, paper-like skin... For the price I was paying I was expecting better dates. ...Not worth it."
3,MIKE S,"Not bad, Not great, but good coffee. Put it on my list so if I can not get my first choice, I have a backup."
5,"Excellent, classic tea","Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea is THE classic breakfast tea, with a full-bodied, hearty flavor, and it's delicious for breakfast or any time. I prefer it with milk and sugar, but it's also good with lemon and sugar (for Americans, at least). It's very handy to buy it in the six-pack version from Amazon, and just a note for you Tassimo owners: it's quite easy to use a tea bag with the blank disc. I usually press the button twice to get a full cup of tea and let it brew however long I like. Highly recommended."
1,greeeeen coffee,This coffee is terrible for roasting.  No matter at what level you roast it tastes more like twigs and grass.
5,Excellent. economical product.,Excellent economical product for a summer or anytime drink.<br />Half gallon water<br />1.5 teaspoons true Lime.<br />i teaspoon stevia powder..<br />Try mixing in a little water then add to the rest.<br />Its a really good drink.<br />Experiment for sweeter if you like.<br />the True Lemon was kind of bitter to my taste.
5,Best coffee available,"Tully's Breakfast Brew in my opinion is the best coffee available for the price.  I drink two to three cups every morning, and it is a great way to start the day."
5,Wonderful Product & Service,"36 Petit Fours for $10.50 is outrageous!! What a super deal!! I had been looking for months for Petit Fours, it was great that Amazon and Swiss Colony could make it happen.  The product arrived in a very timely matter and in perfect condition.  My tea party was a big hit with these dessert favorites.  I plan on ordering them again if I can find this same bargain."
5,Great Bread Yeast,After having rising issues with other yeasts I bought this on the recommendation of many baking sites. Couldn't be more pleased. Keep it in the freezer to extend its life.
5,It Works,I run 12 miles every weekend. I can tell the difference when I don't use this product. I take it and a PowerGel.
4,Fresh and delicious.,This is my first time trying smoked salmon. This is way better than any canned fish. I don't think I can ever go back to buying canned tuna or salmon. The only drawback is its high price. I will definitely buy if it goes on sale again :)
5,Perfect fruit cake,"Just the right size, easy to store, looks great and tastes wonderful.  Superfast shipping.  I don't know why people joke about not liking fruit cake, we like it much better than pumpkin pie."
5,Lucious & sweet,"Many blueberries -- fresh, frozen, or dried -- are pretty tasteless.  So I always buy a bunch when I find some that taste good.  And these are consistently great!  Lots of sweet blueberry taste!  Not as organic as I claim to like, in that they've added blueberry juice and sweetner -- but the effect is wonderful."
5,MMMMmmmm GGooooodddddd,I certainly hope this limited edition makes a comeback next year.  I love this coffee and my Keurig coffee maker.
5,Amazing,Best dark chocolate covered orange peel I have ever tasted.  I just keep ordering more once I run out. I can't find it this good anywhere else.
5,Dog likes em',"These look like regular ole dog biscuits. They don't have a strong smell so you can hold these and the smell will not stay on you hands for a while like other treats. You can put these in your pocket and not worry about crumbling or smell in your pocket if you are taking your dog for a walk. We have a rottweiler and he eats anything you put in front of his face. What's great about these is that they are a lot better and healthier than other treats. Like others have said these are pretty hard. I tried breaking some that are stuck in half and it is pretty hard to do. So, sometimes our dog gets lucky with two treats."
5,BEST cookie ever!,We LOVE Quaker Soft Baked Cookies in our house hold! They have great for everyone. My sons first cookie was a Wuaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie that I got in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. Will be buying alot of these!
1,New!!! Amazon.com sells biscuit crumbs.,I did not know that I was ordering biscuit crumbs. That is exactly what I received. Such a lousy product. It's Amazon's fault for shipping out expires products. Will NEVER order food from Amazon.com ever.
5,My Mom Loved them!,My mother absolutely loved these chocolate bars and I've ordered them time and time again.  Recommend highly
5,package Mishandling?,"This is a great product. it seens to have all stuff my vet recommends for a healthy cat. My cats love it and it's all they will eat.<br /><br />I have bought this item for three years from a local retailer who stopped handling it. It has always been vaccuum sealed. This shipment arrived with two of the bags not sealed. The externel shipping boxes were not damaged so I must assume they were shipped to me from the retailer in the broken seal condition. I buy in quantity so the vacuum seal is important to me.<br /><br />Jimmy Gaulden<br />Shelbyville, TN"
5,Claeys candys are awesome!,"I am totally hooked on Claeys candies.  I can no longer find them locally so off to the net I went.  Of course Amazon is where I first looked, and easily found them.  They came fast, not as crumbs, and yummy as can be!<br />Thanks Amazon!"
5,OMG These are the Best Cheese Snacks!,"I found this brand of cheese snacks at a Whole Foods store in Manhattan and I've been hooked ever since. Unfortunately, WF started carrying their own brand of cheese puffs and stopped selling Michael Season's. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!<br /><br />I like these so much that I ordered a case and had them delivered to my office. Now all my office mates are getting hooked. These taste amazing for being ""lite"", and they have a decent amount of fiber per serving (and relatively low fat/calories). They are all natural, and highly addictive!<br /><br />I've tried the regular variety of Michael Season's Cheese Puffs, and I do not recommend them because they're too rich. The Lite variety taste perfectly cheesey without being too buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Makes an awesome afternoon snack!"
4,Tastes great!,"I have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee I drink so I was very excited to give this a try.  I loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better, but it wasn't significant.  I guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee I drink.  I would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee."
4,Great Mid-Value Treat for Your Dog!,"I've been feeding Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits to my three dogs for years. They're great because they break apart easily, so you can give them whole or break them down for training or to fit appropriately in interactive toys.<br /><br />Some dogs may not be thrilled about the lamb flavor as much as other Buddy Biscuit flavors (our three dogs seem to favor the Beef and Grilled Chicken), but I've never seen a happy dog turn them down.<br /><br />I note these as a ""mid-value"" treat because I've tried using these as a high value treat for a fearful dog, and they just didn't cut it. It's not surprising, as high value usually needs to be something like cheese or meat, but I did want to make the distinction.<br /><br />That doesn't mean they wouldn't be high value for your dog (every dog is different), but they do not work for us.<br /><br />They are not ""mid-value"" as in quality. They are high quality treats, with good ingredients, made in the United States. We currently buy every flavor we can on Amazon through Subscribe and Save, if that says anything about how we feel about them."
5,Nice for a quick sweet fix,"I make large cookies, so I usually get about 18 cookies out of this bag.  We mix as directed, then add a pinch of salt, a few drops of vanilla, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  We bake them up in our toaster/convection oven in 8-9 minutes.  Yummy!  Not quite as good as my old t*ollhouse homemade, but quick, easy, and delicious.  Krusteaz mixes are excellent baking mixes."
5,Happy homemaker.,"We have been using Good Seasons dressing mix for years & as far as I am concerned there is none better, especially the Cheese Garlic.  I had to buy it over the internet because none of our local stores carried it anymore.  They only stock the Italian flavors. Go figure.  I am totally happy with this product."
5,This coffee tastes excellent!!!,This coffee was smell and taste are excellent. I drank this coffee everyday and my family also like it. This coffee very famous to eveyone.<br />I love this coffee. One or two coffee drink was good. this coffee was better taste ever than other product.
3,Dog Health is Important to Our Dog VitaHound,"Our family has 2 dogs- a lab energetic and healthy named Jake, and a Terrier named VitaHound with certain health issues: VitaHound's digestive system is sensitive to typical commercial dog food.  The high grain content triggers allergic symptoms and causes him to have bad dog breath.<br /><br />On the recommendation of friend that has tried tried several premium dog foods and determined Wellness to be a superior brand, we started to to feed VitaHound the rice and duck formula.  VitaHound's bad dog breath disappeared and his allergic symptoms reduced to manageable.  I believe the few extra bucks is a good investment for VitaHound's dog health."
5,CALM Powdered Magnesium,"Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder is the most efficacious way I have found to get the amount of magnesium that my system requires."
5,Delicious sugar & chem-free fruit spread,"I was eating Polaner All Fruit for years until they recently added maltodextrin to it (check the new labels.) I gave this a try as a true sugar-free, all fruit alternative that is also organic, which I purchased from my local health food store.<br /><br />The texture is thick and nice unlike some jellies which are watery. The flavor is good. There are many small seeds in this from the berries which I know some people may not like so I wanted to mention it.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy alternative to sugar-laden jellies or those with synthetic sugar substitutes, I recommend this product."
4,"tasty, but don't expect to lose weight","I have found this to be a nice alternative to my usual green tea, particularly in the afternoon when I don't want any more caffeine.  But I think one has to do a lot more (like exercise and eat less) to lose weight."
5,I love this coffee,"Great tasting decaf coffee. I drink up to five cups a day at work and find this to be perfect. I make a very large cup out of it by running it more than once through the machine, producing about 16oz of strong coffee. Tastes great with splenda."
5,Versatile Bread Substitute,"I'm trying to eliminate white flour from my diet and these are great help.  You can put fruit preserves on them in the morning instead of toasted bread.  They make awesome pizzas - just line  them up right against each other in a pan, top them with tomato sauce, cheese and toppings, bake 350 for about 10 minutes.  They soften up just a little bit and are excellent whole grain pizza base."
5,great protein,"A great tasty way to get extra protein!!! All the flavors are great, and the small packages are the perfect size to not over eat!!"
4,The NOSE Knows,"LILY, my Ridgeback rescue and MIKE, my Wheaten terrier poodle rescue both give these medium size biscuits five stars. I don't know if they really help with tartar but it seems to me that their DOGGIE BREATH is a lot less offensive and that is a big plus.<br /><br />The biscuits take longer to chew than one would expect for their size which is a good thing, No little bits are left on the floor, they really enjoy these. The list of ingredients is long and sugar and salt are both near the top - for that I took away 1 STAR. I would purchase these again and might try the large size as both dogs are strong chewers."
5,Powers,Apparently every third case consumed contains a secret power stick of gum that if chewed for 30 minutes straight gives you a random ability.  Who knew that excessive sweating was a superpower!
4,Looks like good stuff!,"The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner."
4,The only jelly beans I'll eat.,"I absolutely love Jelly Bellys. They are the only jelly bean I will eat. The flavors are awesome, and taste so close to the real thing. The container or pouch on this was fine. As always 2 pounds seems like so much, but the bag just looks so small. And the only thing that I ever to complain about when it comes to Jelly Belly is the price. While I love them, it's hard to spend so much money on them.<br />Otherwise no complaints."
4,"woody,but good",an old woody flavor I used to buy in another brand tea....always liked it.not bad in coffee either.
5,We love this stuff,"We love to  use the cheese topping in macaroni-and-cheese, and can't easily get the product here in the Pacific Northwest. It's nice not to have to go to Florida anymore to buy it."
5,Very fresh and delicious!,"Always one of my favorite Haribo gummi candies, these grapefruit slices are fairly large and because they are thin, have more sugar coating to gummi ratio than most. They have a nice grapefruity taste without being overly sour. They do however tend to get kind of hard if sitting around for awhile, so I was pleased that the bag I got from Amazon was very fresh and all the candy still nice and soft. 5 pounds though is a lot of candy! Vacuum packing 1 pound bags works well to keep them fresh a long time."
5,Forgeddaboutit!!,"This coffee is excellent!  Not to strong, not to weak when made as an 8 oz.cup.  It is by far one of the best values for Kcup coffee lovers.  Enjoy Life, Drink it up!"
5,A taste of Italy,So glad to have found this coffee online. My husband remembers it from his many trips to Italy so I got it as a gift and he was thrilled! Tastes great
5,Ginseng Coffee,"I love this product, it tastes almost the same as the ginseng coffee you can find in Italy; I add milk instead of hot water and it's just perfect!!!"
4,"good salt, good price, but not fine!","I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt."
5,Good dog food,"My Chihuahua is very picky. Most dog food she doesn't like, or will like for a week then get bored of it.<br /><br />We are now into our second bag of this stuff and she still enthusiastically goes for her bowl when we feed her."
1,gummy crust,"My family did not like this crust.  It came out a very gummy texture.  We like the crispy pizza crust.  The waffles in this brand were wonderful.  We were hoping we had found a winner, but we will have to keep looking for GF pizza crust."
5,the best organic food bar on the market,"The Greens Plus Chocolate is the best food bar I have tried to date, surpassing even the Organic Food Bar Brand in my opinion.  The main constituents are dates and almond butter, but I feel that this product's effectiveness comes in the herbal supplements that aren't included in most other bars, such as bee pollen, milk thistle and echinacea. PLUS, who can resist the delicious chocolate coating? Whoever formulated this recipe was thinking about pleasing the palette AND improving the immune system, among other things.  It's a real treat and now is more affordable than ever.  I would recommend this to most people who are looking to improve health and increase energy."
5,Best Lolli's Ever,"I will be ordering these pops regularly from now on.<br /><br />They taste amazing, are organic, actually have some nutritional value, and are only around 25 calories each.<br /><br />I'm doing my best to switch the family to a chemical free diet, with as much organic content as possible.  Just try and read the ingredient/chemical list on a bag of regular pops."
4,Jerky dispinser,"I do enjoy a quick snack, and these little jerky sticks fit the bill.(no pun intended) I pop a few sticks into my pocket for later and munch when I can't run away from work. I'd say they're spicy, but not too spicy to put off those that can't handle the hotter stuff. I still haven't finished off my box, but I'm almost there. I do wish the sticks were bigger, but like I said it's a good little snack."
5,Surprisingly good,"I wasn't expecting much when I got these on a lightning deal. They are suppose to be healthy so I was expecting some cut backs on the flavor. However, it amazed me. The meat seems to be good quality and the flavor was good. If you pick it up on sale like I did, I think it's worth 5 stars. On the original price, probably a 4 star item."
4,Servicable Coffee,"My impressions:  The coffee tastes fine but is unspectacular.  French Roast really burns a good deal of flavor out of the coffee bean and sort of homogenizes coffee flavors, so what you get is a dark roasted coffee (some might even say it tastes a little burned) that's deep and mellow.  If you're a fan of Latin American coffee flavors, this will NOT be the roast for you.  If you like Sumatra or are a general fan of French Roasts, you'll find this palatable.<br /><br />I made a point of drinking this coffee on an empty stomach to test the acidity and it did not give me any stomach upset after 2 cups.  You can interpret that any number of ways.  ;-)<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, I was sent one serving of this coffee by Amazon to test drive.  Because I was not able to brew more than one pot, I cannot adequeately comment on how this coffee might affect someone who suffers from acid reflux anecdotally.  I assume that the target audience (and only buyers of this product) would fall into that catagory, and sadly, I cannot advise you fairly on how this is going to affect you gastronomically.  Also consider that each case of GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) is widely variable based on the individual, therefore this product might be fantastic for some and still too acidic for others.<br /><br />So at this point you may be wondering, should I buy this?  Sure.  Start with as small a quantity as possible, test it for yourself, see how you like the flavor and whether or not the ""low acid"" aspect of this coffee meets your expectations."
5,Great and chewy tasting cookies,"When we got the box, I wasn't particularly expecting much, but after the first taste, I was rather impressed.  Very chewy and soft, they are sweet but not overpowering and have a great chocolate flavor.  So I gave them to my wife and kids to try and before I knew it they were gone.  So, if you are looking for a nice treat that doesn't leave crumbs all over the floor, satisfies the craving for sweets, and is reseal-ably stored, I would definitely recommend these Chocofudge coockies."
3,maybe a 6 on a 10 point scale,"Jack Link's Beef Steak, Flavor, 1-Ounce Packages<br /><br />These are a nice snack, maybe a 6 on a 10 point scale, I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYVKRS"">Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots (120 beef sticks per bag)</a><br /><br />Gunner March, 2010"
5,Best Coffee EVER,"I'm not a regular coffee drinker, so I am very picky about what I do drink. I have not found a better coffee than this, and I've tried. Being a Canadian living in the States, I am so so so very excited that Kicking Horse is now available through Amazon. This has literally made my day! Bold and dark it is delicious."
5,Jill's coffee,My daughter is very serious about her coffee.<br />It has to rank very high in flavor.<br />Coffee People's Jet Fuel brand wakes her up<br />fast in those early mornings. She will drink nothing else.<br />Not even Dunkin Donut coffee !
5,DELICIOUS!,"I purchased these because of the outstanding reviews. I needed some cute, yummy animal cookies for my nieces baby shower. I was making a banana pudding in my trifle dish and wanted little animal cookies to march around the edge and show through the bowl. Well, I am happy to say it worked and these were yummy! I had quite a few bags left and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them! He is now asking for more. LOL So I am going to try some of the other flavors."
5,Barbeque perfection,"The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree."
5,Best Value!,"My dog loves these things, and I love that you can get almost 100 for about $20, if you went to a pet store you'd be paying at least twice as much for these things.  I have a Yorkie, and I only give these to her every so often (I try to remember to give one every other day so she doesn't get fatter).  I really hope that Amazon keeps them this cheap and I'll keep buying them"
5,Great for smoothies,"I ordered this when I began feeling fatigued during my morning workouts, and realised that I might be lacking in protein. I don't eat cereal and/or egg everyday, because I prefer raw food and also they tend to be heavy before a workout and I detest highly processed bars and powders. When I read up about hemp powder, I was skeptical, but decided that it was the only way out to have a sure fire morning protein dose before my yoga workouts.This product has now become a favorite of mine and I use it in the following recipe (almost every day)<br />- blend a cup of unflavored, organic soymilk, a ripe banana, handful of berries (fresh or frozen), some flaxseeds, hemp powder (2-3 spoons) and some honey (optional) to a rich delicious smoothie. The flax seeds add a nice crunch and the hemp gives it a nutty flavor that goes great with the bananas.<br />I'm glad I found this product. Natural, raw, organic and extremely healthy. Perfect!"
5,The name say it all!!,"This bar is like having a piece of apple pie without the guilt!!! I would highly recommend this bar!  I have tried so many ""health bars"" and when I opened them up they all tasted dry and like cardboard....YUK!  Not this one!"
2,probably won't use again,I have to admit I have never cooked with rice noodles before but have liked them in Thai dishes in restaurants.  I followed the directions for soaking the noodles prior to cooking with them but the noodles remained hard.  I did not care for the recipes on the package so created a stir fry out of ingredients I had on hand.  Needed to add a lot more liquid to the dish as I was cooking to get the noodles to have the texture of noodles instead of pretzels.  We liked the finished product OK but I would be leary of trying these again without cooking guidance from someone else who has used them.
3,BITS & PIECES,"My husband really enjoys these cookies. They are crisp, buttery, and great tasting! I recently ordered a four-pack, and when I opened the first box, there were many broken cookies and crumbs of all sizes. It Was Very Disappointing. The second box was equally disappointing. There are to many broken cookies. 33% of the cookies in the box were damaged; that is unacceptable."
1,"If you want to mainline salt, these will do the job","I love crunchy cheese goodies. I thought these White Cheddar Just the Cheese snacks would be a nice little treat but when I tried them, I thought I had bitten into a salt lick. I have never eaten cheese that was even half as salty as these little bits. They were toasty and crunchy but the salt overwhelms everything. I won't be reordering."
5,Not missing the fat at all!! LOVE IT!,"I bought this as I am trying to cut out some fat & calories in my diet & eat more healthy. I received my order today & decided to give it a try. I warmed my water before mixing up my first taste. WOW, this is really good! I placed it on a banana & I honestly do not miss all the fat! Will buy again & again & again! Sorry, Jiff Healthy Mom's choose PB2!"
2,Really trying to be happy,"I've had this product for 3 weeks and have used it a total of 3 times. I'm really trying to get passed all of the kinks.  Of course, most of the poor reviews are after I purchased the Baby Brezza.  I, as some, was lured into the ""one step process"".  I have 3 kids and thought this would be simple to use. I have difficulty placing the blade into the container.  The instructions say don't force the blade in, but that's the only way to get it in.  I'm just hoping each time I don't push too hard and break it.  I'm finding with each use the driveshaft is becoming more difficult to pull out. Setting all of those aside the machine (in my opinion) works great! I've had no problems with puree or steam.  It works beautifully!!!  It does leave too much water in the chamber, but I just pour the excess after I'm finished.  If I can get these problems resolved it will be a nice machine.  From reading the other reviews it seems the problems will only get worse. I'm hoping I didn't buy a lemon."
5,The best chocolate I ever eat,"The chocolate Bar arrive on time, I got exactly the kind that I orderd<br />and it's also Kosher!!<br />I use to eat this chocolate long long time ago and then I couldn't find it anywhere...<br />I was very happy to find it here - in Amazon.<br />Good chocolate - great memories!"
4,Reeelaxing and Aromatic!,"This jasmine tea is very fragrant and I noticed an instant calming effect after breathing it in for a few minutes.  The pearl balls are neat to look at inside of the silk satchet when you open the very fragrant pouch!  The taste is light and soothing, nothing too complicated.  If you like jasmine, you'll definitely love this tea!  I give this tea 5 stars for sight and smell and 4.5 stars for taste.  I wanted a little more spice or something in the taste, but I'm used to drinking black tea.  My favorite by Harney & Sons is their Hot Cinnamon Spice."
5,Great coffee,My husband is very fussy about his coffee and this one is the one he likes best.  Very robust taste.
5,Great Flavor!,"When it comes to gum, I always go for mint.  I've never liked the fruity flavors & I'm not even that into the cinnamon flavors.  But, for some reason, this gum seemed interesting.  I knew if I didn't like it, my husband wouldn't let it go to waste anyway!<br /><br />The first piece I had, I actually said ""wow!"" out loud!  It's really good!  I told my husband it's like chewing an orange Tic-Tac over & over (again, I always go for mint in Tic-Tac as well unless it'sthe orange!).<br /><br />I think this could become a new fav of mine!"
3,Good but EXPENSIVE,"I've been buying this cereal for $35, and my 3 year old daughter even loves it. I went to order another 6 boxes and the price had jumped 25% to $44! Sorry, but that's too much for me. I've switched to another, inferior product."
5,Miss my Ranch,"I have looked all over for this product. Hidden Valley changed recipe to use regular milk and it is just not the same. Now that summer tomatoes are ripe, I can't wait to have the original again!<br /><br />Try adding Bleu Cheese crumbles to this, MMMMM!"
5,"Awesome, pretty healthy, very tasty, not too sweet cereal","I've always loved this cereal, but it hasn't always been available in the various places I have lived.  From a texture standpoint, it's crunchy and robust, holding up well in milk without getting soggy.  But it's also not so crunchy or robust that it's unpalatable, like the straw- or raw-twine-like texture of some high fiber cereals.  It has a decent amount of fiber per serving (5 grams, which is kind of the cutoff for ""healthy"" cereals, in my opinion), and a pretty good slug of protein (6 grams, which is enough to make it fairly filling), and it has a good amount of whole grain oats.  And it is just perfect for my taste in terms of sweetness, having enough sugar that I don't need to add any, but not so much that I feel like I'm having dessert for breakfast.  Great stuff."
4,Good training treat,"This is an excellent training treat for every day.  It's not a ""high value"" treat (used for more challenging training situations) nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive.  It's a good size, though it does make some crumbs.  Plus, ""liver biscotti"" is fun to say!"
4,"Bag keeps getting smaller, price stays the same","My cat has been eating this for years, and it seems that the bag keeps getting smaller and the price (for a while) kept going up!  My cat has very sensitive stomach - so this does the trick.  I just hoped it contained more meat verses fillers!"
5,The very best,"These new On The Border tortilla chips are simply the best on<br />the market theres no comparison to the other tortilla chips on the market, they are very tasty lightly salted,<br />large in comparison to the others, lite tasting, and you can get a huge bag of these chips for half the price of some of the other more expensive less tasty chips, My wife and I will never buy the others again,as long as these are available, especially after trying these, the old saying go's:<br />(Try it you'll like it) WE HAVE AND WE DID...<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049IHZKC"">On The Border Cafe Style Tortilla Chips - 24 oz. (2 Pack)</a>,"
5,great for training,These are perfect for training or to use inside a tipsy kong puzzle toy.  I recommend them... just be sure to properly close the bag so they stay soft (not like it mattered.. the dogs liked them either way).
4,I'm really bummed now!!!,"I bought this coffee from the time it first came out. I loved it and so did my friends. But it was available in decaf and that's all I can drink because I have problems with caffeine. Gloria Jean has evidently discontinued the decaf and I am really bummed out because it was the only flavored coffee I bought. I keep getting notices to buy the caffinated coffee, though I contacted the company to find out if I could still find the decaf somewhere and I never got a response from the company. I guess they don't care about little ole me."
5,Smoothest Whiskey,"I tried this on a recommendation from the guy at the liquor store. He said it was smooth, and man, was he right! This is now my favorite whiskey! Love it."
5,DELICIOUS !,"This licorice is sooooo good. Soft, very flavorful. Hard to find in stores<br />now- this flavor- black cherry- so I would recommend."
5,The best waffle mix,"My mom turned me on to this.  I bought a new waffle iron (the Belgium waffle one) and tried different mixes.  This by far makes the fluffiest, best tasting waffles.  My whole family loves it.  I like the fact that it is thick so it doesn't make such a mess when using my machine."
5,"Great milk, and I am a HUGE MILK DRINKER","Let me start by saying I am 62 and have been a huge milk lover my entire life and if it were not for the calories I would probably drink a half gallon a day. Maybe that is why I have only had one cavity? Anyway, I know milk is fattening so I have at least restricted myself to skim after gradually going from whole to 2%, to 1%, to 1/2%. But I was still concerned about all the hormones in milk and wanted the added convenience of long term unrefrigerated storage for camping and emergency food supplies. I was skeptical of powdered milk but decided to take a chance with Bob's based on the good reviews here. What a surprise to find that I like this milk BETTER than my store bought skim. It tastes just a tad creamier than skim. Did I say I love this milk? When this 4-pack is gone I am getting on the automatic delivery and figure the cost per quart is going to be 82 cents. So not only is it BETTER than my store bought skim but cheaper and LESS calories still. I mix it in a blender with one cup of warm water for about one minute before adding the rest of the water and blending for an additional 15 secs. Perfect. I do it at night, stick it in the refrigerator and in the morning all the ""head"" has disappeared and I have cold milk for my cereal. Those complaining about mixing difficulty should just go buy store milk. It is NOT an issue with me. I highly recommend this milk."
5,Great!,"Both of us really like these.  They are all nuts with a little syrup connecting them.<br />Crunchy and very tasty.  Great value at Amazon price, especially with so many almonds in them."
5,Gawd damn!,"Blood came out where it shouldn't be coming out of and from more than one place. I was like, ""shieeeeet!"""
5,Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits Are Sure to Please!,"I am a pet sitter, and Cloud Star Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits, Sweet Potato Flavor, are a hit with all my four-legged clients!  My dogs love them too!  They are soft, so they are easily broken into smaller pieces for little dogs, and they are big enough to please medium and large dogs.  Of all the flavors, sweet potato is the most popular.  I have not had a dog turn down this treat.  I highly recommend this dog treat!"
3,"Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad","I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other ""Bold"" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the ""soy"" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!"
1,Protein Chips,The Kay's Naturals protein crispy Parmesan  pack of 12 protein chips tasted aweful. I would not recommend them to anyone.
5,Snikiddy Snacks Cheddar Cheese-Sure to Please,"I have purchased this product before, it is fantastic, have shared with friends and co workers, no negative comments, everyone really enjoyed it, this product should definitely be added to lunch programs in schools/universities etc, it being what it is- Natural and all. Thanks for carrying it.  Virginia Keutmann"
4,peanut butter granola - good stuff!,"We tend to add granola to a base cereal (usually from Nature' Path).  I love peanut butter and this granola is the real stuff.  Big pieces of granola, peanuts and relatively low in carbs.  Love it."
5,Great Tasting Light Roast,"I bought these on a Friday special on a whim.  I was running low on k-cups and thought I'd give them a try.  These are fantastic.  I prefer a light roast coffee and these fit the bill.  They are smooth and do not have a bitter aftertaste.  I'd definitely buy these again, whether on a Friday special or not.  It was my first Van Houtte Cafe purchase and I look forward to trying some of their other k-cups."
5,Love these Bars,"In looking for healthy snacks to make it through the afternoon at work, these are by far my favorite.  Not only are they full of healthy ingredients, without containing any wheat, gluten or Dairy, they taste great without being hard as a rock or chalky like so many other bars!  If you didn't know they were good for you, you would swear they were a homemade treat full of fat and sugar. With only 180 calories a bar, you can't go wrong with these tasty treats."
4,The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category',"The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!"
1,Old food.,"Thank you Amazon, for sending me an enormous bag of cat food that expired five days before I received it. Not only did I feed it to my cats several times before noticing, but now I have to coordinate the return of a giant and heavy bag of old food. Unfortunately, there is no way for the buyer to know the sell-by date before purchasing, so we are entrusting Amazon to do the right thing and not rip us off."
5,Crazy over Greenies!!!,"I have two cocker spaniels that are absolutely crazy over Greenies, we have to spell it out and they still know what it is! All I know is that if it makes my dogs this happy then it makes me happy!"
5,Lots of little boxes,These boxes are smaller than the size I normally buy in the store but I think that's a bonus.  They stay fresh longer since they are sealed.  Great product.
1,Not the Sea Bear I know,This was not the product I've used in the past. This salmon was very mushy and fell apart as soon as the package opened. The flavor was fine but the presentation was horrible. I was embarrassed to put it out for guests
5,Beautiful,Exactly as described by the seller. This plant arrived on time and alive and well. Note the size of the plant to make sure it is what you want. It is a wonderful addition to the decor. More money for the years to come! :D
5,Not your typical green tea - from an avid green tea drinker,"I was looking through Amazon's selection of green teas and came upon this treasure. When I first tasted it, I was somewhat upset that it did not really taste like green tea. The taste of lemon grass and herbs seemed to overpower any hint of green tea, which was pretty upsetting... at first. I proceeded to finish the cup while continuing to read whatever I was reading, and then it hit me. After I finished my first cup, I found myself wanting more. Yes, after several sips, yes I was able to start tasting the green tea, but more than that, I was left with this new found sensation in my mouth that I just could not explain. The best way I could explain it was, and this may sound silly, but it was as if little fairies were dancing around in my throat. You have to try it to know what I'm talking about. Are all Yogi teas like this? The tea is wonderfully soothing and energizing at the same time. Try it out! You will get used to the taste and begin to actually fall in love with it. Plus, this tea is full of free radical fighting antioxidants.<br /><br />It's good and good for you!"
5,Omega 3s in a pleasant way,"This goes in my cereal, in smoothies, or most anything else, as the fresh nutty flavor is a plus to most anything....and it's organic.  I always find Bob's Red Mill products to be tops, and this is no exception."
2,"Too much like pringles, I didn't like them","I tried the Classic baked fries with kethcup.  Had I read the ingredients first I would never have bought them.  They are made from potato flakes like pringles and I have never liked Pringles.  These tasted odd to me and we had a houseful of company and a bunch of children under age 6 and no one liked them.  I crushed them up and put them under the bird feeder and only the chipmunks would eat them.  Nothing wholesome or good about these.  Back to my delicious Cape Cod potato chips, I will never wander away from you again!"
1,Not for use in ScoopFree Auto Litter Box,"I got a bag of this litter to try out in my ScoopFree litter box since I'd like a litter I can subscribe to.  Sadly, the fineness of the litter makes urine clump which causes it to jam the automatic box.<br /><br />It also seems that the litter became very wet and soupy 3 days after being put in the box.  Following the ""1 cat - 1 bag - 1 month"" formula, this litter should have lasted my 2 cats for 2 weeks, not just 3 days!"
3,Decent enough rice,"There's nothing really wrong with this rice, but there's nothing really special about it either.  It's serviceable.  I cook it in my rice cooker and the basmati aroma is indeed very pleasant.  I did think, based on basmati brown rice I bought from a Safeway store, that the fiber content would be higher.  It's actually 1g (4% of the RDA) per 1/4 cup.  That's not high, although it's a step up from plain ol' white rice.  Other nutritional details: 180 calories, 38g carbs, 3g protein, plus calcium 2%, iron 6%, thiamine 13% and Niacin 8%. Although not listed on the product label, B vitamins are also found in Basmati brown rice.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, the rice is not theoretically loose inside the burlap bag (which is double-sewn shut and has a zipper) because there's a inner plastic bag.  The plastic bag is cheap and flimsy though, and somewhere along the way a lot of the rice left the bag I got (assuming it started in it) and was just loose inside the burlap. I emptied it all into ziplock bags to store in the freezer.<br /><br />The expiration date is Jan 2014. I paid just under $15 and expect to be eating this rice for many months to come. Make that many, MANY months to come."
5,Wonderful gift,"I purchased this and sent it to a family member as a gift. When it arrived, she called to thank me, saying the fruit was delicious, and it was one of the nicest gift baskets she'd ever seen. She sent me a photo of my nieces and nephews enjoying the treats.<br /><br />It's a little pricier than some of the other gift baskets on Amazon, but it's worth it. Unlike some of the other gifts, this one really does look like the picture, so you know what you are getting."
3,"Great Concept, But Tastes Like You're Drinking a Vitamin","I really wanted to love Cherry Switch. I'm a big fan of cherry-flavored sodas and I like Switch's blend of natural juices, vitamin C, and filtered water. On paper, this seemed like the perfect beverage for me. In reality, it tasted like I was drinking a vitamin. You ever have one of those cherry-flavored acerola tablets? That's what drinking Cherry Switch is like.<br /><br />By no means if the beverage offensive; it's just not particularly tasty. I'll give it credit for being a natural product that offers vitamin C, but I'm dinging it for the taste. Would I got out of my way to buy this drink? Absolutely not. Would I buy it as an impulse purchase if I saw it at a deli? Maybe...but chances are, something else would get my attention.<br /><br />On another positive note, my wife liked the beverage because of its low carbonation. If regular soda is too bubbly for you then maybe you'll enjoy this product."
5,Great Tasting! Super Fresh.,"I admit at first I was a little worried about buying gum from a warehouse. I thought it may be stale or outdated, but to my suprise the gum was fresher than packs I've bought at the store! Very good product."
5,Some of the best,"I like peppermint candy' but I stop eating It because it was either, the hard pepermint which was to hard or the soft mint candy which was to soft. The mint twists are good because if I let it sit for awhile,the out side be hard but the inside gets chewy a little and I can chew it up. Plus the mint just taste better. It really is some good peppermint candy"
5,Great for older beasts,"For some reason, finding morsel-sized soft treats for old dogs at almost any pet store is challenging. My mixed breed wonderdog (Golden/Shepherd/Chow)just turned 14 and he loves these treats which have the texture of compacted brownies. Like a lot of older beings, he now has trouble with crunchy, chewey foods. He won't eat any other treats now other than these quality-made, nutritious soft chews. A bit pricey but highly recommended."
5,Excellent Snacks,Very tasty little snack bites for a quick pick-me-up. Excellent smokey flavor with just the right amout of spices and zing. Would be easy to eat a whole bag if you don't limit yourself!
5,"Fantastic, as always!","I loved this great purchase at less than ten bucks, and they're M&Ms!  What's to say about them?  If you haven't had them, go out and buy a pack, they're a fantastic candy!  I prefer the ones with almonds best, but considering how cheap the milk chocolate version was, I wasn't going to pass up a great deal like that!  Thanks Amazon, I will keep coming back!"
3,Grade B,"I thought it was less expensive because I was buying in bulk.  I didn't notice that it was Grade B.  I wish I had.  It was still pretty good, but I wasn't getting the bargain that I thought I was.<br />It does seem to be thoroughly gluten free though as I didn't react to it and I am very sensitive to low levels of gluten."
5,I plan to re-order,"This product came quickly and is all that it says it will be. Great boost during my distance runs, easy to chew on and eat while running. Besides, I really like the flavor. Great product!"
5,Skinner's Raisin Bran,"I am 74 years old and have been eating Skinner's Raisin Bran since I was about 7, that is, when I can get it.  It is not carried in all grocery stores around the country.  As a 20 veteran of the military, I found myself in areas of the world and USA, that Skinner's was not available.  I will not waste my money on any other brand, so I had my Dad, who remained in the Panhandle of Texas until his death, ship me 4 to 6 boxes at a time.<br />  After he passes on, I Googled ""Skinner's Raisin Bran"" and got to Skinner's (Now U.S. Mills)website.  There I was elated to learn that I could order it from Amazon.com.<br />  To this very day, I still will not buy any Raisin Bran, other than Skinner's.  Oh, yes, I have tried others,(Post, Kellogg and others I can't remember the names of)and they all left me wanting for some REAL Raisin Bran.<br />  I sincerely hope that Amazon will continue to make it available to me at least until I'm 90, assuming I can still chew by then."
4,Doggie treats,"They are good, but cost quite a bit; but you have to know that Tanner (The Cocker Spaniel) is well worth the treat.  Could not find locally after being given a bag."
4,Not all that dark but very good,"Title says it all. This is not a ""dark"" roast coffee but is very flavorful and an excellent every day brew."
5,I love hojicha!,I tried some hojicha I got from a hotel in Japan and I fell in love with it. Then I bought some yamamotoyama hojicha and it was awesome. You should give it a try it has a lot of flavor compared to regular green tea.
5,5DogMom,All my dogs enjoy this product.  They can't get enough.  It is packed with healthy ingredients so I don't mind giving them this treat often.  I can't keep up on the orders as they go through them so quickly.  They are offered through subscription order on Amazon and you save a good amount. I compared the prices with the local pet supply store and these treats go $5.99+ a bag whereas I am paying $21.34 for six bags and free shipping.  I am very satisfied.
5,Some of the best,"This product is by far one of the best cookies this universe has ever known. Tiny TRON discs of delicate and balanced crunch and chocolate that ebbs and flows like a dream landscape, reality becomes liquid candles and you are the wick... set yourself ablaze and eat these cookies.<br /><br />They really are the best cookies, I'd place them side by side with those LU Cookies Le Petit Ecolier, The Little Schoolboy which can also be bought here on Amazon.<br /><br />Why settle for boring cookies when you can eat the best?"
5,Good as it gets for a mix,"These have a ""made from scratch"" flavor and texture.  Very good quality chocolate.  I recommend cutting them in squares and placing in a covered container overnight.  They taste much better the next day (as with many baked goods).  I'll buy again for sure."
5,best tahini for hummus and baba ganoush,This is the one you want in your pantry.  Stir the sesame oil back into the paste before use.  It is so much better than the canned options.
5,LOVE THE POPCHIPS!,I am totally addicted to the POPCHIPS!  They are very good and don't taste greasy at all.  One bag has a lot of chips in them and can be filling.  They are only 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat and they don't taste like you are eating something healthy for you.  I love Cheetos and can't have them anymore and now love these chips.  The flavoring is not very strong but strong enough.
4,Good for Kongs,My dogs really enjoy these but I get a little worried when they get down to the last inch or so as I am afraid they will get stuck in their throat..I stick them in a Kong..won't come out and they still go nuts for it
4,Absolutely worth the wait,"These crackers are really easy for my toddler to hold and eat.  They are packaged well and have a very mild taste, especially if you like rice snacks.  Amazon shipping or supply chain management was horrible, the order experienced three delays, but eventually got here.  On another note, Amazon does not charge you until the items ship.  These crackers were worth the wait.  I may purchase the plain next time.<br />These are always out of stock.  Eat 'em if you've got 'em!<br />Update from 8/12.  I just keep buying these crackers.  Each time they are in stock, I stock up.  Really, my 10 month old daughter can say ""mum-mum"".  Fantastic crackers and easy packaging.  I have not tried the plain, but the vegatble flavor are outstanding!  Bon Appetite."
5,Like mom's...but better,"This is NOT hot chocolate in the classic sense. This is a hot, chocolate beverage not to be wasted on young children or adults lacking taste buds. You have to be someone that really ENJOYS flavors, textures, etc. to get the difference or you might as well stir up some swiss miss."
5,Delicious!!!,This is the best coffee - well worth the money.  So easy to take to work or on a trip - rich delicious coffee in a minute.  Loved the fast service too!
4,Delicious alternative!,"If you want an alternative to high-gluten pasta or even rice or some other side dish, this is a lovely choice!  Soak the dry noodles for a minute, then have your way with them.  I chose to saute some onion, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil and add the Vermicelli.  The result was very tasty, leaving my dinner companion searching the kitchen for seconds.  This is not an all-in-one option. The package contains only the noodles, no season packet or other add-ons.  Seven ounces of dry product is more than enough to serve four as a side dish.<br /><br />I would have given the Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli five stars, but I have a problem with the sideways packaging. The dry noodles, very fine, as expected, are packed sideways in the bag.  To cook the entire bag is easy--just dump it into the soaking water--but if, like me, you want to cook just half or less, removing the noodles from the package to break them in half results in hair-thin bits of pasta sprinkled everywhere.  My kitchen floor is still crunchy."
4,Tough Ball but not for Agressive Chewers,"This is a great idea, and my dogs really loved the treat! However, our big Lab who is an agressive chewer pop those treats out in minutes. The smaller pup loved licking and chewing it for hours."
1,Mud?,"This is some of the worst coffee I have ever tasted. The other Caribou styles are tolerable, some even decent, but ""Daybreak"" was just nasty.  I have never written a review for a coffee before, but I felt compelled to share how bad this stuff was in hopes that it will save some one a few bucks and their taste buds."
5,Great stuff,"Pleased that it has more to offer nutritionally than regular pasta...a given. On top of that it tastes just like if not better than most brands of regular pasta. It is light-years better than other alternative pastas like whole wheat ones that taste like grainy globs of goo. My kids don't know the difference and I don't have to pretend that it tastes good, because it does. As far as the price, I always get mine cheaply at my grocery store. It is only a few cents more than other stuff so...as long as you're not buying it by the caseload-the few cents more is worth it for sure.<br />  Oh and all the smart pastas taste the same- a nice consistency."
5,Great Buy!,"My husband's 86 year old father set us with the task of finding him some turtle soup.  When an 86 year old asks for something you make sure to find it!  We assumed that since we live in Louisiana, where seafood is plentiful, this would be an easy task.  We were very surprised when we could not find it anywhere locally.  When I have trouble finding something I always turn to my reliable friend, Amazon.com, and tada it is found.  I must admit that I was a little surprised that it seemed a bit pricey but after researching turtle soup I realized that it is priced right. I ordered the 6 pack and had it shipped directly to my father-in-law.  He was overjoyed when his package arrived and tried it immediately.  He was very pleased with the taste.  I am sure I will be placing another order for this product sometime in the near future."
5,LOVE Green Mountain's Island Coconut!! Wonderful!!!!!,"I have to tell you that if you like coffee and you like coconut, there is nothing on earth like this Island Coconut coffee from Green Mountain!!! It's smooth, scenty, and quite flavorful, but definitely not overpowering. My husband and I LOVE Coconut anything and we will always keep this Island Coconut on hand. I tried making lattes once with coconut pieces in it and it was ok, but if I ever did it again, I would strain out the coconut pieces, but it still wasn't half as good as this coffee. I will buy this coffee until I can't find it anymore because THIS Island Coconut coffee was better than I ever imagined; and I hope they keep this flavor Forever and it's not really just a limited edition!!!"
5,Brings back memories,"My mom is 82 years old and she has been telling me stories about how her father used to make huckleberry pies and how great they were. I wanted to give her a treat, so I Googled, Huckleberry, and found the company selling on Amazon. I called out to the store itself and spoke with a very friendly young lady named Krista. I wound up ordering their pie filling.<br />I first surprised my mom with the jam and she loved it!  Then I baked the pie and she said it was like her father's. I think she was being kind because the crust wasnt very good.<br />I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Yummy!,"These crackers are very tasty!  Lots of rich, nutty flavor, and they are ""sturdy"" meaning they stand up to salsa, cream cheese, etc.  I dip them in everything!  They ARE less expensive at Sams Club and Costco, but for people who don't live close to one of those stores, I'd highly suggest buying them on Amazon.  I've been Gluten-Free since 2007 and these crackers are in my top 5.  Glutino tastes bland and dry to me, and while we have a local GF bakery that makes DIVINE crackers, Crunchmaster is always a staple in our household."
5,Yummy!,"My little one really loves these crackers!  They are lightweight, delicious, and the perfect size for little hands.  My preschooler also loves looking at the letters imprinted on them."
5,best mix I ever had (Big Sourdough Fan),"Love it. Easy to make. Smells amazing while baking in machine. Good crust and doughy bubbles make the bread aromatic. Great to slice and toast with french brie or use to make a leftover sandwich.<br /><br />It's a great beginner bread too. Try this one first, and then you will want to try all the other flavors."
5,Gotta love Wonka,"I've purchased bulk candies where they are old, terrible flavors, or simply smashed to dust. This was a great buy, having none of those drawbacks."
4,Superb operation,"I received this as a gift at Christmas and have been enjoying using it.  Its very convenient and keeps all the cleanup contained in one bowl.<br /><br />Best feature - the food processor is _very_ powerful and I don't need to strain foods b/c there are no chunks (I do strain peas to remove shells after processing).<br /><br />The steamer is quick and efficient.  With the steamer basket full, I make about one-week worth of single-ingredient food at a time.  I peel foods and cut into chunks before I steam them.  Holds about 2 small sweet potatoes or two pears or one bag of frozen peas.<br /><br />I store foods frozen in silicone mini-muffin pans (much easier to remove than from an ice-cube tray).<br /><br />This device can be used to defrost food - just pop the frozen food in a small heat-proof bowl first.  But, unless you keep a close eye and check a few times, the food gets way too hot.  Easier to use the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir well to make sure there are no hot or cold spots.<br /><br />I will definitely use this when our baby starts to eat our food and it needs to be blenderized first.  The blade and motor on the food processor are fabulous and better than others we have.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The price is way too expensive.  I received it as a gift, but would not have bought it for myself.<br />- The spatula is useless, a small silicone spatula is much better."
4,very good!,Can't complain. Taste good and had quick delivery! It was my first time trying this tea out. I usually drink the peppermint one but this gave me energy and sustained me throughout the day.
2,QUALITY DECLINED,I had been getting this product on subscribe and save for over a year.  The first couple of shipments had great quality.  The food was in half inch squares with a thick gravy.  With the middle shipments the food was cut in little slices but still had a thick gravy.  The last shipment the food was mush with running gravy.  I cancelled my subscription.
5,The Pooch gives two paws up!,My dog loves this food.  It is great for him and helps him maintain his weight.  Other dog foods have made him sick in the past.
5,CuddleyCat,"Was very prompt delivery.My cats didnt like it at first,now they love it.I mix it with thier food.The silly girls , pick out and eat the flakes first.I wish they were not so crumbley.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IW71BQ"">Cat-Man-Doo Extra Large Bonito Flakes, 1-Ounce Container</a>"
5,"Jack Link's X-sticks 30-pack, Bacon-Cheddar","This stuff is great for snacking, has a long shelf life, and convenient to pack for travel.  The taste and texture is awesome.  Buying on-line saves money and time.  I keep a box in my office and another at home.  It is a great way to enjoy group discussions and family time.  Eric D., Wanamingo, MN"
4,Good but a little too sweet,I just received my shipment and the packets are individual tossed into a plastic bag.  Some of the bags are broken so there are powder everywhere.  I'm going to attach a picture to this item if they would let me.  I was looking forward to trying it but I will need to return it.  It is unacceptable to have open food packages.  I'll update my review once it got resolved and I am able to taste it.<br /><br />Update: Amazon customer service is great.  They have a replacement on its way.  They said to throw out the broken package.  So I opened it to see what go damaged.  It might have been a manufacturing issue.  It looks like some of the seam busted open due to lack of glue or the pressure inside the package is so great that it burst.<br /><br />Update: I received the replacement hot chocolate and these showed up in perfect condition.  The chocolate is tasty but a little too sweet for me.  The added crushed peppermint might make it sweeter than normal.  Great for when you have a cold.  It is so soothing and no need to heat up milk.  Just add water.  Thank you Amazon.
3,Cocoa K Cups,"These were fine but the shipment consisted of 6 boxes of 16 K-Cups. Would have been nicer in the 24 Cup boxes currently available from Green Mountain, but the price is hard to beat."
5,Eating Gluten Free,"If you have to eat gluten-free and wonder what to snack on, these crackers are wonderful.  I have tried to find tasty snacks and they are hard to find, however, these crackers are so good."
5,Best Ever,This is the Best canned Clam Chowder that I have ever eaten--I so miss it--since moving away from Maine and now living in the south where u cant get stuff like this-will be so glad to get
1,The  Cost of Shipping is a ripp off,The cost  of shipping is a  total ripp  off.  I don t recommand  this  merchant.
3,For those with a Sweet Tooth,"If you looooove sweet things, this is for you.<br />Its just too sweet for me.<br /><br />I found that putting half, or 1/3, with a regular Via packet suited me just fine.<br />Using only a bit of this product, gave my coffee a hint of caramel, rather than lacquering my taste buds in caramel."
5,Love it!,"I am absolutely shocked that I love this coffee. I do like some flavored coffees but I also like Extra Bold strong coffee, black. And I wouldn't even call myself a huge blueberry fan. I only tried the blueberry because it was in a sampler box I bought. But the smell as it was brewing was amazing. Still I was skeptical as I took the first sip. I mean, really? Blueberry coffee? But it is delicious! Will definitely be getting more!"
4,Not Spicy,These taste great but aren't even as spicy as something that would be labeled jalapeno. I will still buy these but if you are expecting spicy don't be surprised for mild.
5,Grape by far the best tasteing,"I work 85 hours a week, there some days where I just can't shake the tired feeling. I take one of the Grape flavored 5 hour energy and I am all set for the rest of my day. There is no shakeiness no rapid heart beating (that have experienced with other products)or any crash what so ever. I have turned lots of my fellow workers on to it and Amazon is the best place to buy it!"
5,"Very fast, very tasty","These crackers are absolutely delicious, whether you are a celiac or not. The order arrived on time and was in perfect condition."
5,Wonderful Dish Soap and Amazing Aromatherapy!!,Worth every cent is this amazing bottle of dish soap that cleans great and leaves your hands smelling amazing for so long after.  The wonderful aroma makes me want to do dishes even more!!!<br />LOVE THIS SOAP!!!!
5,Excellent product,"Product arrived quickly and as described.<br /><br />Apple Jacks cereal is by far one of the better tasting cereals.<br />When it's packaged like this, it makes it easier to handle for trips or a quick snack during the day with or without milk."
5,Well Balanced Spice and Taste - 4.5 Stars,"They're not quite as tasty as the regular slim jim, but when you want a little more spice these are what you'll need for your Slim Jim fix.<br /><br />Every once in a while you'll get some that have far too tough a skin, and for that a deduction I give them.  I also wish they were lower in carbs.  They can get rid of those carb fillers and up the price if they need.  That tiny bit of carb filler makes a big difference for those of us watching our carbs, and I would love to see those removed, leaving only the carbs used for flavor.  I can only eat a few in a single day because of those darn fillers.  WAH!"
5,Good Item,This is a great option for those with wheat allergies.  Tip:  Don't over cook or they get very mushy.
5,Sweet and Flavorful!,"I've tried a lot of different stevia products, both powdered and liquid, and this is my favorite.  Stevita is carb-free (I wrote the company for confirmation, and was suitably impressed with their quick customer service), which the powdered stevias aren't (Truvia has 3 carbs per packet).  Stevita is fantastic for anyone on a low-carb diet, or trying to cut back on sugar or fake sweeteners.<br /><br />Stevita doesn't have the aftertaste that is so common with fake sweeteners and even other stevia products.  The Peppermint Stevita has a nice peppermint flavor, and just a few drops gives you a nice sweetness with a distinctly peppermint flavor.  It's perfect in a mocha, to give you a peppermint patty taste. When I use sugar-free syrups like Torani or DaVinci, I tend to use a shot in a cup, with this, I'm using 3 drops.  I'm hooked!  I've ordered all the other flavors too, and am excited to try them."
5,Favorite Coffee,"I come from a family of hard core coffee drinkers. They do not like this coffee. Their coffee eats away the inside of their coffee mugs. This coffee is enjoyable and has a very nice flavor. I find I stock up in the fall and try to make it last through the year. This is a light to medium roast coffee with a spicy, fall flavor. If you look for a coffee that does not have that burned dark roast flavor this is worth trying."
5,"Yummy, just like when I was a kid!","Drake's Funny Bones, my favorite when I was a kid. I hadn't seen these in years so I ordered them and they are still yummy!! What a nice treat!"
5,2 Doxies Love Love This!!!!!!,I got a case of Pumpkin to give to my two little over weight doxies. They both are on diets and with this and their low fat food it makes them feel full without to many calories. They really enjoy it and it also smells really good. Plus its good for them.
4,Best tasting cocoa k-cup available,"After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters."
3,All is good,"All mixes were good but the Italian sweet mix was the best, and I wish I can buy this without the kit, we loved as Patty no casing and without the other Spices"
2,"Lower in sodium, yes. LOW sodium? NO!","This tastes just like the regular soy sauce but if you're looking to reduce sodium, keep in mind that a serving (15g or about .5 ounce) is 575mg of sodium. Don't be fooled by the ""lower sodium"" label."
5,Who doesn't love Chef Boyardee?,"Convenient and tasty. Pop it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap, and microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds. I tear up a mozzarella cheese stick and sprinkle it over the top before nuking. My boyfriend prefers his with a dash of Tabasco. I get a bit nostalgic eating these, since I used to frequently have them as an after-school snack when I was a child. Om nom nom, tasty!<br /><br />Tip: Use a napkin bib if you don't want a stained shirt. The sauce is a runnier than typical tomato sauce, and somehow, I always manage to get it on my clothes."
1,DO NOT WORK!!!,Hello.<br />I tried this product and found out this DO NOT WORK AT ALL AT LEAST WITH DOGS!!!!. What waste of money. Unfortunately i cannot return the product. I'm still having problems with the dogs in front of my balcony. Does anyone know i REALLY GOOD product to keep away dogs? Thanks
5,Great Customer Service,"The tree that arrived was safely packaged and wonderfully healthy! I did have a couple questions and the seller resonded immediately and was extremely helpful and considerate! They went above and beyond my expectations. Thank you for the wonderul tree, I'm looking forward to many years of enjoyment!"
5,OMG These are so tasty.,"Ok Protein bars are gross.  Especially for someone who really doesn't like chocolate as much as the rest of the world. I'd eat a snickers bar, peanut butter cup and a twix but that's pretty much it.  Chocolate cake yuck. Ice cream.  Yuck.  So it was real tough for me to find a tasty protein bar cause they love covering them in chocolate (though I have found some other flavors such as this) but they aren't in large quantity.  SO I read the description and it said chunky peanut butter.  The coating is coca which doesn't takes like the dark chocolate coating i've found everywhere else.  These bars are tasty.  OMG.  Almost like a recies peanut butter cup but a little thicker.  I could eat these all day long and are perfect!"
5,Great green tea!,One of my favorites -  added to automatic subscription to have it delivered every month.  A little bit of sweetness from the lemongrass makes it great to me!
5,Great Selection,"I was tired of getting bags of assorted chocolate candy that always had a variety no one would eat.  I love that amazon was selling this product and it came in ""bulk"".  I won't run out of the office candy again!  I went ahead and bought all of the favorite brands so I can keep everyone happy."
1,Not The Best Ingredients,"I cannot recommend this dog food.<br /><br />Why?  because it contains poultry by-product meal.  I never give my dogs any dog food that contain by-products.  By-products are essentially the left over beaks, tails, etc. from animals that companies don't know what to do with, so they grind them up and call them dog food.  In addition, this contains ground wheat, and I've learned from past experience that wheat contributes to arthritic symptoms in some dogs.  I also don't like the ""grilled steak flavor"" which is obviously artificial flavoring and has nothing to do with meat.  That's how they can get away with saying this dog food has ""grilled sirloin steak flavor.""<br /><br />I am sorry to give a poor review.  I hate giving bad reviews.  But some of the ingredients in this dog food are just sub-par.  Sorry Nestle' Purina - I know for a fact that you make other quality products, but this isn't one of them."
4,kettle chips,"This kettle chips taste ""Good , Crispy & Crunchy "" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced!"
2,"Unfortunately, I got a bad shipment (I hope).","Amazon kindly refunded my purchase price of this item, as upon receipt it was rancid.  Also, all the bags were one hard ""brick.""  I had to pound it with a meat tenderizer to break it up (I was determined to try it, in spite of the rancid smell). I was disappointed, as I am always searching for a honey oat granola that does not contain raisins.  I was looking forward to a wonderful granola, and the packages I received were inedible.<br /><br />I even offered it to my horses and they curled their lip at the smell.  So again, I hope that I was just unfortunate in receiving an old batch of the product; but at that price, I won't try again.  Hopefully someone else will have had a better experience and will have a good review for what appears to be a great raisin-free granola."
5,Best cracker available,"My wife is on a health kick so thought I would try this brand because it is made with whole grain brown rice, gluten free, cholesterol free and oven baked.  You know usually how some of these foods are tasteless, but not this one.  Best tasting cracker I have ever eaten.  Plus it comes in sealed inner 2 pack.  Hats off to this company."
5,The least grossly sweet energy bars I've found.,"They're still sweeter than I'd like, but they taste less like candy than any other bar I've tried, so they're my favorite. They store well, too - you can carry them around in your bag or car and the constant temperature changes aren't a big problem for them."
5,Breakfast in Bed is a treat,"Fantastic taste, smooth ""feel"", no nasty aftertaste, pairs great with creamer. What more can one want from a coffee? This has become my favorite."
1,Not so good,These protein chips taste like eating cardboard. I would not purchase them again and even discarded most of them. It was a total waste of my money. Would not recommend.
1,not sure who could use this product.,"The product description on line that I read, doesn't mention that this is for relaxed and natural hair.  when I got the product, the container says it's for Relaxed and natural hair..  Relaxed to me means curly hair that has been chemically relaxed.  I wouldn't have got this product, had I known that.  Typically, the type of hair that gets straightened is very thick and dry, so this product could be for them.  I would still question even that though, knowing how difficult this stuff is to wash out.<br /><br /> With no instructions with it there's no telling how exactly to use this.  As a former hairstylist, I've seen similar looking products used on straightened hair to help smooth it down with a flat iron, but  It's not advertised to use that way.<br />It's thick and by the other reviewers seems to be very difficult them to wash out too.  Maybe similar to putting vaseline on you hair.  It says for the scalp and hair, but to even get on my scalp, it would get on my hair, so not a product for me."
3,k cup sampler,crazy cups k cups sampler gave a good variety of samples of flavored coffees.  The only aspect I was not happy with was they gave me a french vanilla k cup for iced coffee.  my keurig does not do iced coffee.  I think it should have said that it may contain unusable k cups depending on your keurig machine
5,Almond extract,I use Almond extract alot aroung the holidays...tired of buying those little bottles for almost $3 each....very happy with purchase.  Great price
5,Love the Alessi Tuscan White Bean soup,"We have been eating this delicious bean soup for about four years now. It's a winter staple for us and it's so easy. I normally add some cut up fresh green beans and a little chopped ham for extra goodness but that is not at all necessary. Of course, a little parmesan cheese grated on top never hurt anything. I have found the Alessi products to be of high quality and they have earned a permanent place in my pantry."
5,simply delicious,"Have been using this product for many years. Delicious, healthy and very portable. Kids love it. Good lunch / snack time item. Take to work or come home to a good bowl of soup. Convenient to use. Have on occasion or two had to deal with contents gone bad due to packing defect. Overall wonderful."
5,Amazing Grass,Great way to add protein and veggies to my diet. I add a small spoonful to my coffee in the morning.
5,Great Coffee,"I had never tried this brand before, so I was worried about the quality.  It tasted great.  A very nice smooth rich full flavor.  Its my new favoret."
5,Great food!,Eukanuba Cat Indoor Weight Control and Hairball<br /><br />This is probably one of the best kitty foods I've bought. I think it's very effective with hairballs. I still have to wait a little longer to see if it's effective with weight control.
5,better than chips,"If you love Salt and Vinegar chips then you can't help but love these almonds, they are sooooooooooooooooooooo good!  Yes, the almonds have fat (much like chips) but at least its a good fat for you!"
3,"Awesome sauce, shipping too high.",Guess you're kind of stuck when you don't have any decent ethnic food stores in the area that carries a good selection of products like this.  The price on this was really good (just over $7.00 for 24-oz bottle) but they charged $6.60 to ship it.  It doesn't weigh that much.
5,SO IMPRESSED!!!,"I could not believe the price for these almonds, THEY WERE SO CHEAP!<br /><br />I thought that maybe the almonds were low quality or something because the price was so low, but I ordered any way and was SOOOO IMPRESSED!<br /><br />They are large almonds and are so tasty!<br />they were wonderful! I still cant believe they are so cheap I bought another bag!<br /><br />I definitely recommend!"
5,Soooo Good,These bars are great.  I bought them thinking that they were not going to be good and I was pleasantly surprised.  I keep one in my purse everywhere I go so I never find myself without a gluten free snack.  This helps me not trip up and have something with gluten if I am stuck in a situation where I can't find something good to eat.
1,Yuck,I honestly couldn't taste even a hint of peanut butter or chocolate in this product.  Waste of money!  I'd rather not have peanut butter than attempt to substitute with an inferior product like this again.
5,Chery Tootsie Pops!,Perfectly packaged and quickly received. I will definitely order this item again. I'm going to see if they have tootsie pop drops now.
5,"Shih Tzu LOVES, LOVES, LOVES these!","Bought b/c she, age 3, likes the ""Made in USA"" Bravo trail mix, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00423UVBO"">Bravo! Premium Freeze-Dried Training Treats for Dogs, Trail Mix</a> .  She absolutely LOVES Bravo Turkey Hearts.  I can get her to eat dry food more often when I break up a turkey heart in/under/around the kibble.  It's fun for her to find the treasure and I like that she eats plenty of dry with it!  Very pleased that the ""best by"" date is nearly 2 years away.  Another favorite of hers is Zuke's Venison Z-filets, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HXYWHG"">Zuke's Z-Filets High Protein Dog Treats, Venison, 3.25 Ounce</a>, but she really goes wild for those freeze-dried turkey hearts!  [BTW, she wouldn't even try Bravo freeze-dried Lobster treats, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YTZYJA"">Bravo! NEW Freeze Dried Lobster Treats</a>, the fishy smell is soooo strong. Thought she might because she likes salmon, but no such luck.]"
2,If you like sugar and water...,"I really really wanted to love this product. Both my wife and I are fans of pumpkin spice coffee, and we hoped this product would give Starbucks a run for its money. However, all you really get is sugar flavored water. We used 4 teaspoons as suggested and it was too thin and too sweet, so we cut back to 3 and it was just sugary water. We went to five and all that happened is that it got sweeter. Yes, it has a slight pumpkin flavor, but for the most part it doesn't measure up."
5,My favorie tea!,"This is my favorite tea, bar none. I have gone through teas over the years - Stash's Irish Breakfast was my favorite for a long time...  Typhoo, Twinings English Breakfast. Then I stumbled across Ahmad English Afternoon Tea on a remote island in the Pacific being sold by a Pipe and Drum Corps as a fundraiser. I was immediately hooked on that and when I couldn't get that tea from them anymore, I went hunting online. That's when I came across Ahmad's English Tea No.1. It has become my everyday tea. I love the smoothness that accompanies the full body of this tea. I still have English Afternoon Tea on occasion - but this is my fave! I drink it straight hot and cold, with milk and with milk and sugar."
5,Stewpendous!,"Well, all of my babies love this food.  They are sometimes a bit picky, but this food was a sure fire hit!  It is in pate form, but you can see the veggies."
5,I heard this stuff was the best,"I figured I'd try this for dipping cake pops. And it does seem to produce a thinner, smother coating than almond bark. It melts in the microwave better than almond bark and is easier to work with."
5,Best Tastin,This is the best tasting sugar free shortbread cookie ever. Doesn't even taste sugar free.
5,Paitently Waiting,"Just received this wine kit, thought the name looked different, so wanted to give it a try.  Just started it yesterday and waiting for the first stage of fermentation to finish.  Will update when it is finished and have tasted it."
5,I love this coffee,"My daughter-in-law introduced me to Decaffeinated Vanilla Bean Latte 3 years ago. When I can find it in the stores, I drink it every morning as soon as I get up. It makes my day."
5,Snapea Crisps,Excellent taste at an affordable price.  The snapeas arrived in tact and in a timely manner.  I will definitely order them again.
5,Delicious and healthy organic sugar!,"It is great to find an alternative healthy sugar! I've been using it and it tastes delicious and feels healthy. I use it on my cereal, oats and sprinkle it on our ice cream for dessert, it is sooo yummy. I also tried it on a recipe of coconut rice and it was the best, all my family loved it!"
3,First Time Try,This was the first time I had tried Kind Bars and thought the Macadamia and Apricot would be a good one from the reviews. I liked them ok but I didn't find them amazing. I also didn't like that they have soy lecithin in them. I will stick with Larabar.
5,Great!!!!,"Great product, no bleach on my food! Use it to bake, freeze and cover my food. It is a large purchase but I can find it at any of the health food stores in my area so I rather have 2 much than none at all."
4,Great treats!,"Our puppy (5 month old labradoodle) loves these. They are great for training at home or at the park, but don't do the job very well when in puppy class. I think they don't smell as good/strong as some of the other stuff, so with multiple distractions it makes it difficult to get his attention."
4,Makes strong Tea,"This tea makes extremely dark and strong tea on the 11oz setting which is my largest water capacity setting. I use the Keurig Iced Beverage Tumblers filled with ice and can't drink it straight.  My solution is to fill a gallon pitcher with ice, add some water, make two iced brew K-cups and pour it over the ice water for what I consider perfect iced tea.  You can forego the water for stronger tea, or add more water to dilute the tea depending on your mood or tastes.  This tea has excellent flavor, it's just too strong right out of the Keurig for my tastes and in my opinion requires diluting.  Excellent for making a pitcher of tea!"
1,Couldn't even finish one cup,"I'm an avid chai drinker--many different varieties of both lattes and straight black tea.  We purchased this product because we noticed that the Cafe Escapes chai lattes--a sweeter, creamier blend--did not actually have much black tea in it, and we still wanted our morning caffeine.  Neither my husband nor I could finish one mug of this stuff, and we will end up getting rid of the box.  It was that awful. There was none of the subtle spice blending--just a watery slightly clove-tasting flavor undercut by a bitterness that almost had hints of coffee. Adding a little milk, as we usually do, didn't help at all.  If you enjoy chai, I'd recommend Bigalow or Tazo and skip this one."
5,Lovely fragrant green tea,"The jasmine is a wonderful scent as well as tasty. This tea doesn't have the typical ""mushed weed"" flavor that some green teas have (which is why some people don't like it). The scent and the smoothness makes it a great way to get the good stuff (antioxidants) from drinking tea!<br /><br />The 100 count package is good if you drink tea frequently and still lasts for months."
5,LIghtly moisterizing,I really like the Dove Men Body Wash.  I have dry skin and find it to be lightly moisturizing without a greasy feeling.  The scent is also lightly 'manly' without being too much and it doesn't interfere with my cologne.  There are little scrub things in it but I don't think they do much as far as exfoliation.  All in all a good wash for a guy.
5,Excellent and Strong,This French Roast coffee is a favorite for us.  My wife and I alternate between Cafe Du Monde and Coffee bean and tea leaf French Roast.  I found the price on Amazon slightly lower than the retail store in our area.
5,"DisposaKups - great product, wide open choices!","Over a year ago I purchased a Breville K-Cups brewer and immediately found the the available selection and choices to exceed what I had expected. I loved using it and brewing what I wanted, 1 cup at a time. I found that I was paying about 40cents/cup and that was also great.<br />Now the prices have soared to nearly or over $1/cup and that has made me slow down my purchase rate and my enjoyment of my single cup brewer.<br /><br />Enter the DisposaKups and suddenly the price is reasonable again and I can grind my own or purchase Ekobrew and use their coffees. These are so simple, convenient and easy that I really enjoy that my world of coffee is wide open again.<br /><br />Thanks for such a great product!<br /><br />Ted"
5,WORKS!!!,This tea lives up to its claims;  it really works!  Tastes good too!
5,Best food on the market ...,"Great food for my pooch's coat and helps her produce a consistent stool. Switched from Nutro Natural Choice, which was fine too, but considering they are both priced in the same neighborhood and Wellness has a higher protein content, this made more sense.<br />But I probably wouldn't have switched from Nutro if it wasn't for all those recalls a few years back -- it really freaked me out. My dog is glad I switched."
5,Great Product and Great seller.,Needless to say the chocolate is outstanding.  What was equally outstanding was the seller!  I needed this for a holiday gift and when I asked the seller to help... they did.  I received it the NEXT DAY!!!  That's what I call service.
1,OLD & CRUMBLED,"The bars I received were crumbled on one end & light tan in color, which indicates OLD chocolate. That end of the bar tasted awful. I have seen that a million times & I recognize what it means. The other end of the bars had melted & reset, but still tasted OK & were the correct color for fresh chocolate. A second set was sent to me at no charge, however, the same was true of those. Also appeared that the company was not too happy with my complaint, as the second set arrived in a small, smashed box with a tiny piece of bubble wrap floating around loose in the box & had not been secured to the bars with tape to protect them."
5,Best coffee to make at home,"I've had better coffee, but it was in Costa Rica or Hawaii. For making a fresh pot in the morning, absolutely NOTHING beats this stuff. It's well worth the price!"
5,smiles,"Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you."
3,Good but not as good as Full City,"This is a good coffee from Tully's, but it is not as bright as Full City.  Seems to be a little strong without the flavor you hope from a stronger coffee."
5,very good,"my dog love it very much, the fist thing that she wake up in the morning is eat the greenies!"
5,Love this stuff,"I've always wanted to like hot cereal -- I've tried all kinds on many occasions (grits, rolled oats, wheat, etc.). Unfortunately, I've never been able to get past the texture . . . until now.  I picked this up at my local health food store and fell in love at first bite.  We've not tried the overnight method of preparation.  I bought a non-stick saucepan with a lid and cook it at low heat for about 40 minutes; with the non-stick finish, it only requires stirring once or twice in that time. My husband and I have been eating it for breakfast 4-6 days a week for almost a year now."
5,Best darn BBQ in the world... and I live in the South!,Simply the best!  The Syracuse Dinosaur BBQ location is funky and I strongly recommend it if you're in Upstate NY!
5,Best chips ever,"We'd been looking for great tasting, organic snack chips.  After trying these chips, we stopped looking.  Chips are absolutely delicious and great with hummus, salsa or just by themselves.  We order a case at a time!!"
5,Great Kitty Herbs,"As advertised, the product had no nasty stems, which was great.  I like that the catnip is organic, and the ""kids"" all love it.  Great product; would buy again."
1,Not a replacement for pico-balla candy!,"I read that these candies were replacing the discontinued pico-balla candy which I loved so much. These are not even close and I did not like them at all. Each color is a different flavor, but none of them were very good. I was very disappointed."
4,good popcorn,I had ordered the the GN popcorn to go with the popcorn machine that I purchased for a Christmas gift for my husband.<br />The 6 oz size was perfect for a family of 4. My husband loves the convenience of the portion packs and the popcorn tastes very close to movie theatre popcorn.<br />It was a bit salty for my taste but my family loves salt so they loved the popcorn.<br />I just ordered another pack but this time the 8oz portion size for bigger gatherings.
5,Excellent salad dressing!,"This is an excellent quality salad dressing and I am sorry it is not presently offered!  Flavor, consistency and taste is the best.  I have used as a marinade for chicken and fish - wonderful!  Cant wait for it to be available!"
5,Delicious! Good For You! Tastes like candy!,"These are great! Ever since we were first introduced to eating them in an Indian restaurant we have ordered them here online at Amazon.com. We always found Amazon helpful and trustworthy, no matter what we order. For years now we order from them and are always satisfied. No matter what you want or need it seems to always be on Amazon! Amazing! Anyway; After the meal they had these candy fennel seeds for a last minute treat for breath and digestion, at the cash register. We enjoyed them so much ever since!"
5,The budweiser of popcorn is actually really good,"I'll keep this short.  I'm a beer snob, but I'm also a popcorn snob.  Bad popcorn can ruin a night out at the movies for me.  I also buy my popcorn from a popcorn company.  One day my supply unexpectedly ran out and I had to get some popcorn quick! I bought this at my local store; It was pretty damn close to the premium brand I'm used to (fireworks popcorn).  It actually had bigger volume.  That said, I'm too loyal to fireworks (it's better too).  Nevertheless, if I'm in a popcorn bind I'm buying this!!!"
5,Fig Newton's are not for Losers,"I demand you to eat more of this product ... Soon, this item will be mandated by your government to be consumed by all ...  cause it's sooooo damn good!!!"
5,Vita C lollipops,"Thanks for offering something organic with the ""C"" in it.  It was a way to get something good for the kids in them, while also giving something sweet.  And I'm told they taste just like regular lolli's! I sent them as gifts! So, now my nephews and my bestfriends granchildren get to have the extra ""C"" through the cold winter months."
4,I like them.,"they look nothing like the picture on the package. they're pale, not brown, nor do they have indented creases or what have you. that was the first thing I noticed. I like these as a salty crunchy snack that I can feel good about eating: low calorie, protein. some pieces DO taste a little bitter, but I don't mind. they really taste like PASTA. some pieces are light & crispy which I enjoy most."
5,Fabulous gift for a hot sauce lover,My husband loved this gift.  He loved the new hot sauces and shared them at his office with his staff and brought them home for us to try.  Huge hit.  Next time I will gift hot sauces for the whole year.
5,What can you say?  They're Cheez-Its,"The title says it all.  Why would Amazon suggest I write a review.  If you like Cheez-Its you will like these.  They're Cheez-Its.  If, however, you do not like Cheez-Its, don't buy this product because they're Cheez-Its."
5,lite desert,"Theres always room for jello!!! If you like blue berries try this.  Its not a heavy desert, but it will hit the spot if you want to nibble on something thats filling but not bloating."
1,New formula,"My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it.  However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae.  The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.<br /><br />I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas.<br />*********<br /><br />I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.  And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?!"
5,Awesome Syrup,This is the second time I have purchased this maple syrup and our whole family loves it.  Great Flavor!  Amazon is amazing!
5,Quality Street is at it's best,These little nuggets are so good. I cry because they are being discontinued when I have just found them. What am I to do?
5,Very good coffee !!,Its a very good coffee !!!  A little goes a long way but Im a coffee addict so the stronger the better plus<br />its not bitter and nasty.  Great stuff !!!!!
4,the best coffee,"it's the best if you like dark and bold. my wife thinks it smells foul but i like dark coffee, chocolate, and beer. this is a rich coffee experience.<br />the only caveat is all K cups are, in my estimation, overpriced. AND they are not recyclable."
4,"great oil, smells awesome. the bottle its in is terrible though.","this oil is great. smells just like coconut -- you would expect to taste sweet coconut from smelling this, but it doesnt taste sweet at all, its just the essence of coconut flavor. great for shrimp and anything if youre not afraid of some coconut. i like that it hardens at moderately low temperatures. good way to make fake chocolate, with some cocoa powder n sugar. hardens in about 20 min in the freezer. tastes and feels very much like chocolate this way. great oil, high fat content, which is cool if you need to consume fat.<br /><br />that said, the bottle they put this stuff in is horrible. both bottles i got felt all oily after first use -- and i was very careful taking it out. and they remained oily after i wiped them down thoroughly with paper towels. all my other bottled stuff stays clean n dry. i tested the bottle, shook it while completely sealed over my sink, and the stuff definitely comes out despite the twist on cap. thats the only thing i didnt like."
5,"Coconut oil fan, here","I really like to use coconut oil for baking. It produces a much lighter end product than shortening does, and it's much better for you. Also, surprisingly, there's no heavy coconut taste. For health purposes, I also stir a teaspoonful into my coffee in the morning. Nutiva Coconut Extra-Virgin Oil works just fine. My only gripe: unlike with olive oils, as far as I know, there's no such thing as EXTRA virgin coconut oil. It's the same thing as virgin coconut oil. I suppose they label it that way for marketing purposes, but I never like to promote a myth. In any case, Nutiva works in every way that I expect it to, and buying the 54 ounce jar of Nutiva is the most economical way that I have found to buy it."
5,"Roland White Truffle Oil From Italy, 3.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)","Very intense white truffle flavor, maybe that's why the bottle is so small. Worth every cent tho!"
5,Buckwheat honey at it's best.,"My doctor told me to get buckwheat honey and use it in oolong tea twice a day to help soothe a cough that was lingering on way past a cold had ended.  I sometimes go into a temporary type of asthma after having a chest cold.  My doctor's recommendation works very well. This is dark, very flavorful honey.  Some may think it is too strong, but I think it's great; especially used to sweeten tea."
5,Lovely,"I love this cereal because it's organic and simple. It's not loaded down with many ingredients, and the few that they do have in there are (mostly) organic and not genetically modified. All together, we are presented with a healthy, elegant, and VERY tasty cereal. The granola is rich! The cereal is nice and crunchy. I can eat it all day, everyday. :)"
5,We love love love this powder!,"My husband is an avid espresso drinker. He will make up to 3-4 mochas a day, drinking them before and after work. I'm not a fan of coffee but love tea and drink a comparable amount of tea to his coffee. His favorite coffee house is Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, but they aren't as convenient as Starbucks and he now has a professional set up at home to make his own.<br /><br />Before this product, my husband used flavored syrup like they use at Starbucks and really liked the syrup. I bought this for myself to recreate a sugar-free, chai-tea latte. Husband was skeptical because it was sugar-free, but tried it and loved it. This powder has replaced the syrup and a lot of calories because it's sugar-free. My latte's are also out of this world (I use a chai-blend from Teavana.)<br /><br />Please be advised, my husband found the best results with his mocha by adding both the vanilla and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QNLVCY"">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Chocolate Powder, 16-ounce Containers (Pack of 3)</a>mixed into hot milk. He then combines with the espresso and enjoys hot or over ice.<br /><br />We have both on auto-delivery and frequently run out before our next shipment. Highly recommended (& SUPER great price, these sell for $11.95 per container @ CB&TL)!"
5,The mild cheddar cheese of Ghee butter,"Sometimes when cooking Moroccan style foods you need to use a tangy tasting ghee to mimic something closer to ""smen"" to saute your foods. Pure Organic and Swad brand ghee are more subtle and just like sweet cream butter in scent. Ziad brand is tangy as a stick of cultured butter that has had time to 'age' into a delicious mildly tangy scent and taste. Like comparing a mild cheddar to cream cheese."
5,I love this,"This is the first I've tried powdered PB, and it's wonderful! I've used it in granola bars and that was a big hit! Nom, Nom, Nom. Will order again."
5,popchips are great!,Great tasting chips and low on calories too as each bag has just 100cals. I loved the popchips themselves and its a great idea. I dont much care for this chili lime flavor though but i can definitely see myself getting other popchips flavors that i would prefer more.<br /><br />The flavor is evenly balanced out between spicy (chili) and sour (lime). I personally dont like sour chips much but these werent too bad in that sense. The chili is quite spicy though. It worth a try unless you really hate spicy chips or sour chips.
5,"Excellent, reliable yeast and will last a long time!","I keep this yeast in my freezer and it always performs for me (I've had SAF yeast last years in the freezer with no problems). I usually re-vacuum-seal and freeze half of a pound of SAF and then keep the other half also in the freezer in an airtight, stainless steel container. This yeast can last about 9 years sealed in the freezer without losing much oomph at all (and probably STILL more active than most store-shelf yeasts sold at the supermarket).<br /><br />This yeast rises FAST if you put your covered bowl or pan of dough in the sink with some warm water (or placed in a slightly warmed oven) and it works far better than expensive ""bread-machine yeast"" if you use a bread-machine.<br /><br />If you make a lot of sweet dough which requires more sugar, then add some citric acid and powdered milk to help aid the yeast to rise (about 1/2 teaspoon citric acid and 1 teaspoon powdered milk per batch of bread dough) or you can buy Saf's 'special' yeast (gold package) for doughs that use more sugar.<br /><br />If you've been disappointed with your baking endeavors in the past, it was probably the crappy yeast and not your baking skills, so get thee some quality baking yeast and you'll have success at long last.<br /><br />Happy baking!"
2,not impressed,"Expect some caramel flavor, but found none.  I thought it would have a sweeter flavor, but was a really weak tasting coffee.  Would not buy again."
5,Aspen Cider Spices,Just what I ordered.  Have used this product for several years it is our favorite. Good price.  Better than in the stores.
5,My 1 guilty pleasure,Popchips is the chip of the century! I love them all but the original is the best! I wish they would make them sodium free though!
5,great maker,i use this pot every day and it makes great coffee no matter what kind i use.  been using it about a year now and don't want another kind.
2,Damaged and expired,"The item came in a reasonable time, so I was happy about that. The package was completely damaged and falling apart, which could have been the postal services fault. The product had expired almost a month prior. The item seems like a really good one in which I hope to try and have a better experience next time."
1,Could not finish,"At first I was a little disappointed that I only got one pouch to try, but after tasting it I'm glad. The ginger in this drink is so strong that I can't bear to finish it all. I drank about half of it hot (it makes about 8 ounces)and it did not taste right. I let it cool down and drank a little more, then proceeded to dump the rest of it out. I feel that was torture enough. It's SO strong. I normally like teas and other things with ginger flavor, but I cannot recommend this drink."
3,not for my cat,"Unfortunatly my cat would not eat it, and he is not that picky. I gave almost all the cans to a friends of mine who has 3 cats, she said they would not eat it either. Bad batch? I do not know.... Would not buy it again...."
5,Roxy's favorite,My cat loves Temptations and turkey is her favorite.<br />Ordering in quantities from Amazon is a great time and money saver!<br />She also loves the chicken and tuna...she's very particular...I can't sneak in any other flavors but these three.
5,Better than Nutella!,This Chocolate Hazelnut Butter is soo much better than Nutella. I've been trying to keep my sugar intake low and I can feel better about my this indulgence with only 7g of sugar!
4,Shhhhhh,"This spice mix been has been my secret in my fried chicken ( I add a lil to the dip and I add some to the flour mix I use). Also, I've made a bunch a random dipping sauces with this mix. Be creative folks, no need to always follow recipes, you'll be surprised."
5,"a good granola, for once","This is a good granola. I like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things, and a few nuts tossed in. Nice taste. Thanks to Amazon for carrying so many gluten free items! Makes like so much easier!!"
4,Kerri D.,"I received my sampler pack and was pleasantly surprised. I will be ordering more. Entire household enjoyed the coffee. Love the name and idea behind it, very creative. Brings me back to my roots."
5,Best Deal in Town,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25VSM"">Embasa Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />This item is hard to find and expensive ($5.29 a can) in our local community.  I ordered just one case my 1st order, but will need about 3 cases to satisfy the pepper lover in this family."
5,Thumbs Up,Hassle free transaction.  Product arrived ahead of schedule and in good condition.
3,Great Variety,"They definitely came through on their promise to not have a single duplicate! It is pretty awesome if you are a coffee snob and want to taste a veriety of different flavors. I surely found what I did NOT like, but my pallet is not refined enough to sort through so much variety.<br /><br />I would recommend going with a smaller variety pack, unless you just want to spend a lot!"
4,"Good - not very ""spicy"" ...","I liked this just fine.  The name is a little misleading:  It's really not very spicy at all.  It does have a lot of flavor, however.  I've tried it on sandwiches (very good), and on tacos of various types.  I liked it best on fish tacos, with shredded lettuce and chopped tomato.  It also works well on chicken tacos and burritos.  I also liked it as a salad dressing for a ""southwestern"" salad (romaine, corn/black bean salsa, chopped tomato, a few ounces of chopped cooked chicken, mixed colby/jack cheese (or pepper jack), a few sliced black olives, and a couple of tablespoons of this sauce.  Amazon's price is quite good compared to my local grocery stores."
5,Best Thing Ever,"Best Thing Ever. Try the chocolate first, then the iced cafe mocha then vanilla. Chocolate is by far the best. Even my two year old likes it. 10 servings of fruit and vegetables and 16g of protein. Can't beat it."
5,Nothing else works,"I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat."
4,"Very good, but a little bland","I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (11g protein, 3g unsaturated fat, 7g carbs.). The Teriyaki variety is a little bland in comparison to some of the other flavors. This may be exactly what some people are looking for. I prefer a little more kick."
4,Good coffee with a small flavor boost,"The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored is a very smooth tasting coffee.  There is a very small hint of vanilla flavor that did NOT have a chemical taste.  However, I would have preferred more of a vanilla flavoring as opposed to the minute amount in this coffee.  All in all, this is a good coffee that is not bitter.  I would recommend it to coffee drinkers but not to those who are looking for a burst of additional flavor."
1,Smell is VERY strong,At opening this package the Salmon smell is VERY strong. My son made UGLY faces at first bite. I couldn'te get him to take more than 3 bites before he threw it back at me. He is only 1.<br /><br />I suggest NOT buying this in LARGE quantities.
2,Questionable expiration date,"My son loves these Fiddlesticks so I buy them.  Yes, it's expensive and yes, I worry about giving it to him in the car (in case I slam on the break) or when he is running around (in case he falls) but overall, I'm happy with the ingredients and I will keep buying.  Having said that, I am not completely happy with regard to Amazon's fulfillment.  I purchased these in September 2012 and the expiration date shows October 2012.  This is the second time I received ""nearly"" expired Fiddlesticks from Amazon.  I purchased different flavour Fiddlesticks from a local retail store before I purchased these from Amazon and its expiration date is April 2013.  That makes me think that these particular Fiddlesticks have been sitting in the hot Amazon warehouse for over 8 months before my son gets his hands on them.  Technically, they are not expired but I don't think I will buy these again from Amazon.  I don't like to give snacks to my son that often and I'm not sure if he will finish all 6 boxes in 30+ days."
5,Dogs go nuts for these liver treats,"When I first go my Havanese puppy 1 1/2 years ago, the breeder suggested these liver treats for using when training.  My dog will do ANYTHING for these treats.  They even use them at the name brand pet hotel we use in Phoenix.  You have to be careful not to give too much, but my dog, Tanner, got over his separation anxiety when I started the routine of asking for a kiss, then giving him a treat and then leaving.  Now he just wants the treat, I have to beg for the kiss."
3,An interesting snack,"I like this snack, though it is not without its negatives. First, it is expensive... but then again it is suppose to be healthy, so that's a plus that makes up for some of the expense. Also, it seems like a good snack for kids. However, sometimes there is an unpleasant flavor with the ""Tropical Fruit"" flavor. It is not pleasant when you get a bad piece of dried fruit in your mouth. I also tried the ""Organic Strawberries"" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5. The strawberries are good to eat with dark chocolate."
1,well ...,"This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity."
5,Creamy and Delicious!,"This has been my favorite soup since I was a child many, many years ago, and I still heat up and eat the smaller, 10 oz. can at least once a week.  It's my comfort food!<br /><br />My husband also likes this soup, but one of the smaller 10 oz. cans aren't enough for two people, so I was thrilled when Campbell's came out with a 26 oz. can.  Now, I can just open one large can and fix enough yummy, creamy, delicious soup for BOTH of us, and we are very satisfied with the large bowls of soup we both get."
5,My Dog LOVES These!!!!!!,We give these to our dog when we go out. It's the only thing we've tried that she will stop everything and start munching!!!!
5,A favorite of my autistic son,"Although made with butter (my son is GF/CF), my son has no digestive or behavior problems after eating these.  He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade."
5,I Don't See The Issue...,"I have a three year old pure-bred English Bulldog that is THE most powerful chewer I have ever seen. I only bought this toy about 3 hours ago and he's been gnawing away at it. So far, he hasn't put a noticeable mark on it yet and also hasn't popped the treat out of the center. So, I don't know how all these other dogs have managed to destroy their toy or retrieve their treat so fast. As another reviewer stated, I believe the treat ball would probably be best for the ""dumb"" dogs and the Bento ball for the ""smart"" chewers.  But, now at the 3.5 hour mark, my bulldog has tired himself out from chewing on the ball and it is sitting in front of him with noticable marks on the treat surface, but the blue ball still looks brand new (well, with a little slobber on it.)<br /><br />I would highly recommend this toy for your power chewing dogs!"
4,Shiny teeth :-),My dog cannot get enough of these and I feed him 1 everyday and have been buying them for a few years.  Every year my vet asked what I dog to keep my dogs teeth clean!?
5,Simply the Best,"I like strong coffee and found that some of the other K Cups were too light tasting.  This is the best one yet.  This is all i drink now.  I like mochas and sweet coffee drinks from Starbucks and Coffee Bean, so that should give you an idea of how my taste is skewed.  I mix this coffee with International Delight ""White Chocolate Mocha"" creamer and it is the bomb!  Perfect hint of raspberry with the chocolate truffle flavor.  You will not be disappointed."
1,Bad,When I recieved them in the mail they were squished and melted. It was like having a chocolate and mint dented brick in a box. I couldnt even separate the paper envelopes from the chocolate so that I could eat my chocolate brick.
2,Grounds for not ordering again,I love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other K-cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable.  Wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging.  I will not order again because of the waste.
5,Drank it all,Good stuff!<br /><br />Refreshing... I can't say I'm partial to any one flavor of Gatorade having now tried a bunch... but this was an easy flavor to devour... It was a good deal too.
2,"Peculiar taste, strangely bad for a cookie. Alien food.","Even the worst cookie is still good right?<br /><br />My first impression after biting into this cookie that is claiming to be chewy and gooey: ""Wow! Why does this taste powdery?"" Second bite: the same. The weird chalky fabricated taste stayed from start to finish. In addition to this strangeness was the the eerie feeling that these cookies weren't even baked. It seemed more like they were pressed out of a mold.<br /><br />This all being said, I did eventually eat the whole bag but I would never buy them again.<br /><br />I would most certainly never recommend these to anyone."
5,Old time licorice flavor,"Hard to find that old time licorice flavor anymore. I have ordered this twice and shared with friends who have ordered and shared with me. If you are a hard core black licorice fan, this is for you as you will not be disappointed."
2,Failed to deliver as promised,"This Mother's Day order was represented as being a ""Platinum Collection"" bouquet, and what arrived instead was a down-graded selection of mediocre cut flowers, some of which were already wilting. Included was a note stating that ""Mother Nature"" had not cooperated in providing Falcon Farms with the assortment of blossoms as represented in their online offering, but they had made ""appropriate"" substitutions. Having ordered less expensive arrangements from this vendor in the past, I find their decision to offer a lesser product (and with no offer of a refund for the downgrade) inexcusable. I do not recommend this vendor, and will not use them in the future. Their quality control (not to mention customer service) is obviously slipping; I recommend you take your business elsewhere."
1,Great except for one huge design flaw,"I got the Beaba Babycook as a gift, and adored it for several weeks. I work and have very little spare time to spend in the kitchen, so I loved being able to steam and puree my baby's food without having to clean multiple pots and pans. Then, after about a month of regular use, I noticed a foul odor coming from the well where the water goes. I looked inside and saw that a brown crust had formed there. I figured it must be lime deposit that had turned brown from being exposed to the hot temperature of the babycook, but when I tried to descale the well, the vinegar did almost nothing to remove the brown deposit, even after several attempts. I was also very worried to see that the water that ended up in the steamer basket was brown, thus suggesting that if I tried steaming more veggies, the deposit would end up in my baby's food.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer, and they recommended using distilled water (although there was no mention of this in the manual). So, I exchanged my now completely dysfunctional Babycook for a new one, and tried again. Within two days the brown film had developed, even though I was using distilled water. I don't know much about appliance design, but I figure there must be something really wrong with this gadget if it takes only a few days for such a deposit to form. And the odor is truly foul - no way I want my baby's food within a foot of whatever it is that collects there.<br /><br />I don't see any mention of this problem in other reviews, but at the same time, I can't imagine that I am the only person this has happened to, given that it happened TWICE to me. Too bad - I really loved the idea behind this product!"
5,New Espresso Drinker,"I purchased this brand of coffee when I purchased Bialetti Moka Express L'Original 12 Cup Espresso Maker. Up until now, I've had no experience with either. Normally, I'm the type of person to find one brand of coffee and stick with it. When the price of my current brand of coffee shot up, I started looking around for something else.<br /><br />What caught my eye was the Arabica/Indian/Robusta blend. It sounded so exotic. Plus, the chocolaty flavor in the description. I've never been one for dark coffee, but if it had a chocolaty undertone, I was in. Besides, the onetime cost of $20.13 for a pack of four (as of 07/23/2011) was reasonable.<br /><br />My cup of coffee is mixed with equal parts of cream, but my husband only uses a little. Both of us agree this is a smooth cup of coffee with no bitter taste. We love it so much that I've signed up for the subscribe and save plan. Now it's only $17.11 for a pack of four. Again, this is as of 07/23/2011."
5,LaraBar Jocalat Chocolate Coffee -- Excellent!,"I have recently discovered LaraBars, and their whole-food sugar-free goodness. This was my first try of the Jocolat line... as has been suggested here, it's probably best to buy a single bar somewhere before buying a pack of 16 of them, and the chocolate coffee version was the only one I've found locally yet. So that was what I tried -- I love it and immediately came online to Amazon to order more.<br /><br />It's much more like a dessert than the regular LaraBars to me, almost like a brownie. I like the kick of coffee in it, and wonder if it helps with the flavor that some seem not to like. On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors. (Dates seem to be the main source of the sweet in LaraBars.) Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br /><br />In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to. It's all those mushed up dates, which makes it very gummy, and then the contrast of the nuts. I'm past this now, but I know that some will just not like the texture.<br /><br />My only hesitation with this specific product is that I'm not entirely sure the niche this has in my diet. The regular LaraBars seem better as ""food"" (I eat them sometimes when I miss or am late for a meal). This seems more like ""dessert""."
5,Scrumptious every  must have,"This is the BEST!! I mix two scoops with a s amount of cold water to make a paste. This helps eliminate clumping, then add my hot coffe to it. Mix and drink. Yummy...sometimes I'll also add a squirt or two of sugar free chocolate syrup by Torani.  Try it you'll love it!!"
4,This Makes a great gift!,I bought this for my son and daughter in law for christmas and they just love it!  They said it was so easy to use and they love seeing the growing plants in the dead of winter and can't wait to start tasting...
5,Best K-cup Coffee!,I bought the Kuerig because I love the Dunkin Original and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend.  Rodeo Drive has now become my favorite.  It is very delicious and smooth.
5,Wonderful!,"I absolutely love these cherries.  They are perfect.  I have read some reviews that say they are oily, but this was not the case for me.  So far, I've used them in salads & for eating out of hand & we all love them!  I was worried b/c I had heard thru our local food co-op that cherries did not do well this year, but found these to be great."
2,Something changed,"I have loved Pecan Sandies for many years.  Since late 2008, they didn't seem the same - either I changed or they did.  My family agreed there was something wrong, we exchanged some at the store, bought a few weeks later from another store... they're different.  They used to be kind of buttery soft and 'sandy,' but now they're cruncy hard and the flavor tastes like something was left out.  I was hoping it was a bad batch, but now it seems like my favorite cookie is no more."
5,Almost can't believe it's decaf,After being told no more caffeine I thought my days of enjoying a cup of coffee were over. I have never tasted a decaf that was any good at all. Until now. Yes you can believe all the good reviews about this coffee. I can't tell you how happy I am to finally have a decent cup of coffee again. Ty Emeril and TY Amazon for such a great price. With subscribe and save it's less that 20 bucks for 50. With free shipping. Hello? I have been to Starbucks hundreds of times and I have to disagree with a previous poster..this does not taste like Starbucks. Yes it is a dark coffee but smooth as can be and no aftertaste. You are going to love it!
5,Yumminess,"I waited until I made this bread mix a few times before I would review it. This has by far been my favorite bread mix. I have completely given up on trying to make my own and will now ONLY buy this.<br /><br />A couple things to note is 1.) I let the dough rise accidently for 2.5 hours and I must say this was the best accident. The bread rose above the pan and rolled over some but it was almost like it completely changed the texture of the bread. It was way more fluffy like real bread. I will from here on out be letting this dough rise for at least 2 hours. 2.) I like to place foil on it half way through so that the crust doesn't become too dark, and 3.) when I pull it out of the oven I  like to baste it with milk and it softens the texture of the crust."
2,5 stars Silk - 0 stars on Expiration,"Silk is great stuff, and these aseptic packages are supposed to be good for a year.<br />That doesn't do much good when there is less than 2 months left on the product when received.<br />I stocked up for the winter in case we can't get to town to buy fresh.<br />Ordering Silk via Amazon is a bogus shopping experience; they can't be returned because 'technically' there is nothing wrong with the product.<br />5 stars if you're drinking it next week.<br />0 stars if you're stocking up for 6 months from now."
5,Both Cats love the milk,Both my cats love this milk.  I actually think the supplement is helping the 20 yr old cat.  She is more frisky and walking better as she does have arthritis.  Please do not take this as a vets advice...
5,will buy again,"I bought seeds to grow this product and they were not fertile so I guess I'll just have to buy more of this. It's FABULOUS! Not sure how to describe it... it's a hot pepper, but has a distinct flavor. lasted quite a while (less if you like it spicy!)"
5,Figgie Goodness,It's a ton of fig newtons so how can you go wrong. If you've never had a Fig Newton then you owe it to yourself to try them. It is its own unique flavor and texture.
1,Not Chocolate,"This did not taste like a chocolate bar at all. I can't describe how it tastes as I haven't encountered something like this before. I know that is is suppose to be better for you and it's all natural but honestly, I've had slim fast bars that tasted better than this. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this as it went into the garbage."
3,Raspberry Tea,"I've looked for several years to find a Raspberry flavored tea, when I discovered this one.  Thanks.  It tastes really great!"
5,My dog loves these,I have purchased all the flavors and our dog enjoys them all. I like the size for calorie control and the ingredients don't include any junk!
5,Simple,"Only two ingredients in Wright's liquid smoke: smoke and water.  I usually just dilute this in water and soak the meat for about 10 minutes on both sides.  You don't get that nice, pink smoke ring around the meat, but the flavor is there.  I had a small amount of leakage in the box that this product came in, but there didn't appear to be any significant loss of liquid.  Makes the box smell good, though!"
4,Decent if they are microwaved.,"Alright, I have always been a fan of these ""cookies"" as well as Titan's brand of protein cookie. Recently they have changed their formula on the tri-o-plex cookie, adding 30 calories and giving the cookie the texture of very dry dirt. The only way I have found to make these cookies pleasurable to consume is to microwave then for about 15 or 20 seconds to soften them up. That being said, once you do the microwave trick, they are actually fairly decent.<br /><br />The Titan brand protein cookie is actually moist straight out of the box with only 300 total calories for 2 cookies, aka 150 each. The Tri-o-plex cookies are now 171 calories a pop. Overall, these are a good source of protein and in a convenient package you can toss in your car on the way to the gym.<br /><br />They are NOT energy bars, just protein bars and actually have a fairly small amount of non-alcohol type sugars, aka these aren't going to give you the boost of energy and sugar you might need if you are wanting to juice up before a work out. I would consider these a decent protein / post workout cookie. If you need some energy, get a glass of grape juice and throw 2 scoops of grape Jack3d in it.<br />USP Labs Jack3d, 250-gram Tub Ultra-concentrated Grape Bubblegum - Needs Only 4-8 Ounces of Water Per Serving!

4,Fancy FeastTuna,"Most of my cats like it.  I can only feed it to some, though.  I have one cat that is allergic to fish."
5,My Pitbull Loves These!,"I've used these for about two weeks now, and my 9-month old pitbull loves it! I would definitely recommend this product."
5,My dog will only eat this brand,My pug had stomach problems and I have tried every food out there.  The only thing that worked was Science diet until I found this one.  Its more natural and my dog does enjoy eating it more and have not had any problems since I switched a couple of years ago.  Love this brand.
5,They stopped selling this in my local store but amazon saves the day,They stopped selling this at Walmart which made me sad but then I found it on amazon which made me glad. You have to buy in bulk but (going by the ones that I received) they don't expire for over a year so as long as you store it correctly you should be able to buy in bulk even if it's a small household like mine.
5,"Wonderful, original, elegant and fun product; great for gifts!","I really enjoy this product.  I bought two.  One for me and one for a birthday gift.  It comes with a cute little teapot and lovely and tasty flowering teas.  The shape of the teapot allows you to view the tea as it takes form.  You can fill the teapot up with water about 4 times to make several cups of tea, so you can easily enjoy it throughout an evening.  I highly recommend it."
1,Hazelnut (Filberts) in a fragile crescent shaped tea cookie.,"Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress."
5,it's showtime,"this is micheal keaton's funniest movie ever.he worked with tim burton in the 1st 2 batman movies.tim burton i'll admit is pretty freaky with his movies because they're all the same beetlejuice,batman returns,nightmare before christmas,and now willy wonka which i know will be wierd.but i give this movie 5 stars because its got some pretty good effects for the 80's.i just bought the second volume of the cartoon which is cool but i cant find the other ones"
5,The Babies Say Yum Yum...,This pack is a 12 pk of 4 oz jars<br /><br />-3 Banana Apricot<br /><br />-3 Peach Oatmeal Banana<br /><br />-3 Plum Banana and Brown Rice<br /><br />-3 Prunes and Oatmeal<br /><br />We have used all of the products except the prune and oatmeal.  The babies love the food and I have found Earth's Best to make a high quality product.
5,Delicious High Quality Taste,This tea is high quality and you can tell by the delicious flavor.  It takes me no time to fly through a box of this so buying it on Amazon is a great deal for me! I think it is a great thing to drink while breastfeeding and my supply has never been low.  I guess I should attribute it to this tea :) It sure beats health food store prices!
5,LOVE this stuff!!,I've been doing Weight Watchers and PB2 is great for helping me stay on track.  I can enjoy peanut butter for 1/4 of the points and it's so much easier to use in my smoothies since it is a powder.  The chocolate flavor is great to use with celery as well.  I will never use regular peanut butter again!
5,Delicious! Highly Recommended,"I get my favorite Earl Grey (Supreme) from Harney and I saw this tea while perusing their website. I bought a tin of sachets simply out of curiosity and it was a fantastic decision. The tea itself smells like Thin Mints - sooo yummy! - but the taste is mild and refreshing. It's like a peppermint tea but with much more depth than regular herbal teas. It's great for after dinner, but I've also been drinking it in the morning (instead of my usual Earl Grey - hell must have frozen over) because it's been so cold and dreary and this tea is a perfect fit. I love it and will definitely be buying more!"
5,Delicious garbanzo beans!!!!,I just made delicious hummus with the garbanzo beans. The beans are way better than what I could get in the local grocery store. I am very happy with the quality and will buy from this seller again :)
4,Nice and Spicy,"We've tried a few spice recipies for making jerky, but this is the easiest and best yet. The directions seem a bit unclear if you are making jerky from sliced meat, but we follow the directions for ground meat, adding enough liquid to moisten all the meat before marinating in a bag for 6 hours or more.<br /><br />By mixing original and spicy flavors, we get jerky that is not too hot, not too bland, and not too salty (which has been a problem with some recipies). We think it's good, and our friends all ask for more."
5,Garden of Good Eating soy corn chips,"I love these chips.  Nice alternative to the regular.  Small size, but sturdy enough for the thickest bean dip. Travel well with minimal breakage in bag."
5,Better Than Health Store Brand,"After using store brand soy protein powder for more than five years, my source went out of business.  I stumbled upon Bob's Red Mill and found it to be superior to anything else I've used.  It mixes easily with milk and fruit for a smoothy and the taste is so mild, it does not interfer with the other flavors in the drink.  This is an excellent product."
5,Dave's Review of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut Coffee,I have been using this coffee since purchasing my Keurig B60 brewer. It is a great tasting flavored coffee which I start my day with. I drink anywhere from 2 to 5 cups a day depending on what I'm doing. I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the internet marketing and the coffee helps me get through the day. I highly recommend this coffee for anyone who likes a great cup of delicious coffee.
5,Japanese Loose Leaf Green Tea,This is just what I thought it would be.  I purchased this as a gift for my boss for Christmas and he and his family really enjoy it.
5,Yummy,My nieces and nephews loved the Oreos. The Oreos were nice and fresh and were packaged so the cookies didn't get crushed doing shipping.
5,The best stuff ever!,"We have used this seasoning for the last few years and regularly serve to guests when having Salmon.  Everyone comments on how good it is.  I was so disappointed when Costco stopped carrying it, so I had to order online!  You WON'T be disappointed. It is amazing and the larger container is the best deal!"
5,great tea!,this is one of the best teas i have ever tasted! It is good alone but with milk and splenda...wow.. and my blood sugars are so much lower since starting the teas.
5,I'll never Have another slim Jim again,This jerky is the greatest jerky ever it taste so good it comes with 50 links for only 15 bucks!!!! i bought this last month and i just finished them i'm buying more right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Maple sugar very good.,What I ordered was what I thought I would get and I was not disappointed.  Thank you for your promptness.
1,Apples are not properly cored,"These are the same that are sold at Trader Joe's.  Unfortunately, I won't buy them anymore.  About 1 out of 5 pieces have tough bits left over from the core.  They really need to do a better job in coring the apples."
5,Best gluten-free pasta we've tried,"I've known about my celiac disease for over 25 years, tried many brands and varieties of gluten free pasta, and Tinkyada - hands down - has the best in this variety and all others they make.  It's not particularly sticky, and very much like ""regular"" semolina pasta in texture.  The taste is excellent.  My (non-celiac) wife loves it!  She doesn't even bother making two different pots of pasta anymore because she finally found one of ""my"" pastas that was quite satisfactory for her too.  I don't feel like I'm giving up ANYthing with Tinkyada's products over what I used to to eat in my ""BC"" (Before Celiac) days.<br /><br />One other nice feature is the price.  It seems to be a bit more expensive than some other gluten free pasta products, but compare the price AND the weight.  Once both are taken into consideration, I've found that Tinkyada doesn't cost much if any more than the much less desirable brands of gluten free pasta, and it's often less expensive.  This truly earns 5 stars, and I try to reserve that for the best of the best."
3,Not very wholesome,"I got this dry food for my Labrador who has a bad pancreas.  When I read the loving description I expected a more wholesome product with better ingredients.  I specifically hoped for a food with less animal fat.  According to the vet, our dog should not have more than 12% fat in his diet.  Of course, this is our issue, not everyone else's.  Let me provide you with the top five ingredients listed:  Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat, brewers rice.<br /><br />Label Facts:<br />Crude Protein:  28%<br />Crude Fiber:  3.0%<br />Crude Fat:  16.0%<br />Moisture:  12%<br /><br />All the pieces are the size of a pea except for the ""tender pieces"" which are not quite as large as a quarter.  Frankly, they feel spongy and are very dry.<br /><br />The bag, although made of a sturdy plastic is not sealable.<br /><br />Hope my review provided you with the information you were looking for."
5,A MUST for every gluten free diet,"Love, love, love the new Pamela's Whenever Bars.  The flavor is true to the name and the convenience can't be topped.  Perfect for the gluten free diet and also for insulin dependent diabetics.  They have found a way to make the carbs slowly digestable and the use of agave nectar gives a sweetness without the typical blood sugar spike from regular sugar.  Can be used as the perfect breakfast bar or afternoon snack.  Delicious!"
5,Why eat white orzo when you can have whole wheat??,Such an excellent source of fiber.  One of my favorite pastas to fix for salads as well as a side dish with entrees.
5,I own several bottles now,This makes my mornings complete without having to drop a lot of dough at a coffee shop. It's the only way to go.
5,Good Conditioner,Hardly any scent (which is very good!) rinses out easily and leaves my hair soft and sheeny after blow-drying.  I only had to use a small blob though I have shoulder length hair.  Makes it super easy to comb out tangles.  This conditioner worked great for me.
5,Great food,My dog is a picky eater and he seems to like Royal Canin best. He hasn't refused it yet and my cats seems to like it too!
1,Too thin to hold anything,"Although low carb taco shells are a great idea in theory, these shells are just to thin to hold anything and get soggy before you even have time to fill two.  I have one box left that I am wondering what to do with."
5,Great Dark,I am a dark chocolate person and I love this bar.  It is low in sugar and high in cocoa flavor.
3,Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.,"We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience."
5,Knorr Seasoning,Have known product for many years - since I lived in Europe from 1971 to 1985.  It is an excellent taste ehancer and can say nothing but good things about it.
4,steamed in half an hour,I placed the lentils in a pyrex bowl and steamed for thirty minutes.  They tasted fine and even better mixed into steamed quinoa.  I put off cooking these lentils because I was afraid they would be too much trouble but steaming in my Oster steamer was easy and quick.<br /><br />I didn't find any pebbles in my first batch.
5,Really Good Hot Cocoa - Highly Recommended,"These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite, very good even on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the ""small"" cup and good on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Peppermint - Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting<br /><br />These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
3,Great sardines but with oil,"Their sardines are excellent, but caution--these are not packed in lemon sauce, but lemon flavored olive oil.  Their only variety without oil are those packed in tomato sauce."
2,Disappointed,I've been eating these bars for years and I've notice that lately that the quality is not<br />as good as they were before.  They have these hard things in them that can break your<br />teeth! So quality control is not being monitored and I'm going to call the company and<br />let them know that the last 4 boxes I've purchased are not up to par. They taste really<br />good as long as you don't bite into something hard. It's like biting into a nutshell<br />and they need to know this asap.
4,Tasty coffee,"I love Italian roast coffee.  While this is not the ""best"" cup of coffee I've ever had it is very good for a Keurig cup.  The roast is nice and dark, but no bitter aftertaste, and does not have the almost burnt taste of some dark roast K-cups I've had.  It still has a robust flavor when you use it to brew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee."
4,Very good seasonal coffee,"My wife and I purchased this to try a little different taste from our Keurig coffees, and overall, it delivers on what you would expect.  It has a distint pumpkin taste without being overbearing.  It is not our favorite Keurig flavored coffee, but it is enjoyable for something different."
2,Not as advertised,"While the flowers were delivered on time, the product looked nothing like the picture.  Not even close.  Not colorful, cheery and was just blah.  I was disappointed with the handling of this order.  Won't order from them again as it was expensive and not worth the money."
1,Bad Packaging of a Fine Product,"Starbucks again has made an exceptional product and almost ruined it with bad packaging!<br /><br />The instant coffee is in a new world of flavor (for instant) better than most of the coffee in hotels for example.<br /><br />BUT BUT BUT<br />the tube package is a disaster.<br />It is hard to open.<br />It does not open across the entire width of the tube<br />SO the powder is very very difficult to get out of the<br />tube.<br /><br />Indeed, the tube shape is about the worst imaginable for<br />easy emptying.<br /><br />WHO IN STARBUCKS HAS SUCH TROUBLE WITH PACKAGING?"
4,pretty!,Very pretty petals! They will go great for my wedding this fall. I will definitely be ordering more!
5,Keurig Coffee,The shipment arrived on time.The Keurig bundle is a perfect gif for coffee lovers.It contains aside assortment of flavors and blends
3,"Look like good treat, but my dog won't eat them","My dog loves Stella and Chewy's, especially the carnivore kisses (dog crack), so I thought I'd try these.  My dog refuses to eat these.  She won't even bury them for future use.  She just gives me a look and spits them out.  I tried giving them to my mom's dog since mine won't eat them, but her dog doesn't want anything to do with them either.  I don't know why they don't like them."
5,Protein and Fiber and Taste Really Good,"I was attracted to these because they have more fiber than most, along with more protein. I think they taste great!"
5,A very fine Tea,This tea was very good. I was Very happy I got it. A tea that is so good for you and will help many things in your body. My breathing felt better after the first cup. I will be buying more again soon. Doug in Calif...
5,Addictive!,"These wafers remind me of those regular chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafers I was addicted to as a child...now if Glutino could only make those flavors gluten-free!  Yummy!!  Lemon flavored is a great start!"
5,Improved my cat's health,"One of my two cats prefers to eat dry cat food, and so many of the foods on the market have a ton of fillers. I'd grown increasingly worried that she wasn't getting enough of what she needed in her diet, especially now as a senior cat. I switched to this food several months ago. She loves it, and her health has noticeably improved! Her coat has thickened up, she doesn't have itchy skin like she used to. Her arthritis isn't bothering her as much either. I'm very glad I switched to this dry cat food."
4,Better than regular lollipops,"I've been taste-testing these all day, and I can tell you they do taste better than the average lollipop candy you'd find at the kids' hair salon. I'm not naive enough to believe that every single part of this candy is organic and natural; however, if this lollipop is even half of what the two dad makers claim, then that is already many times better than the high fructose corn syrup craptacular lollipops on the market today. I found the taste of these YummyEarth much better, and if I have to choose this brand or a store brand, I'll pick this one."
5,amazing snack - even for picky eaters,"My family of picky eaters loves these things...  I buy them by the case from amazon... I love that I can ""binge"" and not feel guilty... and for my kids, they are a great snack in lunches or whenever.  My kids and their friends just love them.,. they have the appeal of ""junk food"" without the junk...."
5,Wonderful Yogurt,I have been using this product for about 6 months. I have had consistently good results when making yogurt with this starter. I tried to make follow up batches with yogurt I had made previously and it just never was as good as using this starter every time. One of the big secrets I have found to good yogurt is making sure that you mix in the starter thoroughly. Definitely improves the consistency.
5,I love this coffee,I've tried a bunch of different coffees in my Keurig and this is my favorite.  It smells so good when brewing and tastes great as well.  Smooth and tasty!
5,Love this stuff!,"I found this stuff when I switched to glueten free diet, but after adding glueten back to my diet, I still eat this several times a week. Some of the reasons I love this: it doesn't  become completely mushy, has a nice texture. Not crunchy, though. The flavor is nice, but I add brown sugar and frozen blueberries and cook with half milk/half water (of course not frozen once I eat them). Another great thing about this cereal is that it cooks quickly, comparing to steel cut oats. If you're a hot cereal fan, you'll like this, if not...send it to me. I'm so excited amazon carries this with prime (finally!). I've been buying this in 25# bags direct from BRM, now I can buy smaller bulk!"
5,After shower skin softener,"Right after showering, put a dab in palm. It starts to melt and then rub it in feet, legs, elbows, tops of hands...It is amazing. Real lasting moisturizing skin softener. And all natural. Smells great too."
5,BEST RICE MIXTURE IN THE WORLD !,"FIRST BOUGHT IT IN TOWN, BUT IT BECAME HARD TO FIND---USUALLY SOLD OUT---SO I ORDERED IT FROM AMAZON. NOW IT'S ALWAYS THERE WHEN I WANT IT.  GAVE SOME TO OUR DAUGHTERS AND SOLD THEM ON IT TOO.  4 CONTAINERS DON'T LAST LONG NOW !"
5,Tuna Helper for the gluten free rest of us,"I missed easy to prepare meals when I had to stop eating gluten, so I was really glad to find this and discover that it is as yummy as it's tuna helper counterpart ever was.  Nothing to be missed, in fact might even taste better.  Easy to prepare, I think adding 2 cans of tuna or 1 larger one makes it better though.  The price is a little steep in the stores for 1 box though."
5,GREAT NATURAL PRODUCT FOR DOGS,"I usually do well when I order Zuke's dog treats. They are natural without a lot of unnecessary ingredients. My 2 dogs love these, and they are the perfect size for training and using as rewards. They are small enough that it is enticing to my dogs and they want to do more to earn another one."
4,they do the job,This is a natural sweetener which does the job. Similar to other brands.<br />My impression is that their sweetness is not quite as potent as another brand we use.<br />But that is being a bit picky.<br />Recommended.
5,Best cup of coffee from a Keurig yet.,"Tried these pods since they were on sale, and glad I did.  Very robust but super smooth flavor, almost sweet.  The only downside to these is having to keep them in a sealed bag, which isn't much of a negative...  Can't stop raving about how good this coffee tastes.  My husband loves strong coffee and I usually don't like most of them because they can be bitter.  This is the smoothest strong coffee I have ever had!"
5,Good For Indigestion,"This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes."
1,"Paper ""cans""?","We have been ordering this coffee for years. Now, all of a sudden, they have changed the packaging. The ""cans"" are no longer metal. They are coated cardboard. This material does not protect the flavor of the coffee, and it makes a big difference in the final  brewed beverage. Why is amazon sending such an inferior product? Not sure if we will reorder."
5,Yum!,"I drink Starbucks regularly and wondered if I would like their newest flavored varieties. I was pleasantly surprised.  The base coffee is still good and the vanilla is not overwhelming. It doesn't taste artificial and  is fairly subtle. I like that it's got the extra flavor, without being sweet (as in adding shots of syrup).  I would drink this often."
1,Why it's important to read these reviews...,"Never having tried Community Coffee before, I jumped on the opportunity to purchase some at a discounted price, in addition to S&S. I didn't get a chance to read the reviews before purchasing, ""Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground Coffee, Medium-Dark Roast..."" It wasn't until I tried this product that I realized, 100% chicory simply isn't COFFEE. The label is misleading as Chicory is a root, and used as a coffee substitute. It's an unfortunate waste of money and I've learned my lesson - read  Amazon reviewers before purchasing, because fellow one star reviewers would have given me a heads up on this fake ""coffee""."
5,Baby doesn't like it.,"I love Earth's Best products (except their diapers, they are very hard and stiff and seem uncomfortable for my baby) and this isn't an exception. Baby doesn't really like it but we keep trying because babies tastes change. I only buy Earth's best babyfood and the thick consistency is much better than Gerber's stage 3 veggies."
5,My husband loves cookies made with this and he does not need gluten free!,"I made chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, and brownies with Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix. My husband pined for more brownies. He asked  for more cookies saying ""They were really good."" He can eat regular food.<br /><br />Me: I am sensitive to the buttermilk solids in this mix, not lactose, but casein. When I eat too much dairy casein, I am irritated to say the least. I do better with a gluten-free diet, so this in moderation for me is fine. I use Pamela's Bread Mix and Flour Blend when I can as it is dairy free."
5,My Kitty LOVES this food.,"I got this for my Maine Coon Cat who is about 8 years old and he really likes it alot.  It seems to be good quality meat and he seems to be doing well on it.  You can tell it is ""real"" tuna by the extremely ""real"" fish stink it leaves behind lol.  My cat goes nuts however and loves this stuff ALOT."
5,Delicious tea,"This is one my favorite black teas.  It isn't sweet or too spicy like many orange teas, which is why I like it so much.  We moved from Oregon to Pennsylvania and I couldn't find it in my local grocery stores, so I was happy i could order it online."
5,A good reward for my pet and wallet.,You will know if your pet likes these within a heartbeat.  I now buy the 19.5oz to get more for my money.  These are great for overweight dogs but keep it at a maximum of 5 or so a day.  These are high in protein and are as natural as they can get.<br /><br />Very easy storage and have not had an issue with freshness.  I like to keep a 4oz tub on hand to refill from my 19.5oz.  You will not be disappointed!
5,Caca powder and Maca powder,I purchased cacao and Maca powder and I've been in love ever since i received it! It's great for vegans and vegetarians! I made raw chocolate candies out of them! This is a great product!
5,Nice System,"I have been using the Keurig OfficePro for about a month.  It's fast heating, easy to use and clean.  I like the three size choices and the 48 oz water reservoir."
4,Better packaging,"Good everyday olive oil. Good color, good yup-this-is-EVOO flavor.  Nothing remarkable, but an excellent value for the price.  Also, apparently they seem to have improved the packaging since previous reviews were left - it was packed in it's own fitted cardboard box with inserts to keep it still and suspended, inside a larger box with air-padding.  Had a very minor dent.  Pouring was a bit awkward with the spout, but it only dribbled a trivial amount.  Would recommend."
5,Delicious Meaty Dog Food,"Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
5,best honey available,I have been using this honey for quite some time. Honey does have different flavors. Not all honey labeled clover honey tastes like clover honey. This one does & comes at a great price
5,Still going strong- 6 weeks later,"I ordered these for my wife for Mother's Day, and they arrived May 8. It's now June 24 and the flowers are STILL bright and fragrant and firm. When the flowers arrived, about half were open and half were still buds, so there was a nice staggering of blossoms. Still, the longevity of these flowers is amazing- we've got about half of the original bouquet left, which still looks impressive in a vase. I would definitely buy these again, but from the look of the flowers now, it's going to be a long time!"
5,Great for Storage,"This item is great.  It sits right next to my Cuisinart Single coffee maker.  It stores and keeps neat many K-cups, exactly as it is descrived.  I am thinking of buying another to stack on top of this one for more storage."
3,shipping costs more than the product,I have been looking for tubed ginger and thought I had finally found it. But the shipping for this item costs more than the item. that drives the cost way up. No a good value buy.
5,"Yummy, Healthy Anytime Snack","I like to keep snacks on hand, but not the classic junk-type snacks.  These are perfect for our family.  The kids are able to grab them anytime they need something to munch on, and I don't worry about them OD'ing on chips or candy.  We love all the flavors; they're tart and chewy, just right for a sweets craving."
5,Can Taste the Love,"Very tasty, quality healthy snack. Easy to take on hikes & is a rewarding treat to have at the summit. Comfortable knowing it's locally made with care & quality ingredients."
5,Great taste without the Sugar,"This is our second time purchasing this product, we don't notice the difference in taste between it and the high sugar drink mixes. Great product, we will be buying again."
5,Good water,"I enjoy the taste of the water, my family and neighbors that have tried it also like the water.<br />It it's worth it and it has an interesting story."
5,yum,"This tea has a delicious flavor, fresh and light. I love it, and this is a great price. For regular tea drinkers it is a great deal on Amazon's auto-order feature."
5,"Perfect ""Coffee"" for Tea Totalers and Caffeine Haters","My body doesn't handle caffeine well and I don't like its effects, even with black tea. Thank goodness for Pero. It's rich and robust without nasty caffeine because some of us tea totalers get tired of the wimpiness of herbal teas. I like to add milk and sugar for a richer coffee-like experience. And for those who thrive on instant gratification, it dissolves immediately without having to wait 3-5 minutes to seep. Pero costs almost twice as much in retail stores, so I was ecstatic to see it on Amazon at such a deal. Only problem is having six containers means that I'll probably won't have to buy Pero again until 2010."
5,Yum city!,"These are GREAT chips.  I love that they have no salt added.  They are slightly sweet, go great as a side to a sandwich, and the crunch can't be beat.  Sweet potatoes have more vitamins than white potatoes, and if you're looking to reduce the salt in your diet, these chips are for you."
1,enfamil 20 cal  2 ounce  48 pack,amazons price for 48 pack  2 ounce  enfamil is 160.00<br /><br />from diapers . com  it is 60.00  something is wrong<br /><br />I think amazon must have a misprint<br /><br />or is trying to jab us<br /><br />the product is the best  but not at these prices
5,My pup's favorite brand of canned food,"My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase."
5,Milanoguy speaks truth,"My 12 pack just arrived, and I've eaten two and want another one.  These are seriously good and in an hour's time, I have come to believe I couldn't live without them.  Crack, indeed!"
5,Did a 360 on 479 Popcorn,"I am a college student, but even I wouldn't mind occasionally shelling a bit to get this great gift or snack. Originally, when I heard of it at a party, I thought it would be like any other popcorn. Yet, when I first had a kernel, it was airy and melted right in your mouth. Unlike other regular caramel popcorn, this one wasn't too sickly sweet and I could eat it all day."
1,overrated,A real disappointment. I normally buy Kirkland Signature dried montmorency cherries from Costco. The Costco cherries have a much brighter flavor and a nice tart sweet snap at the end. These taste dull almost raisin like initially with a hint of cherry at the end.
5,"Lipton Iced Green Tea, Sugar Sweetened Iced Tea Mix, Blackberry Pomegranate","I drink this regularly, and it tastes very good.<br /><br />It tastes sort of mild and fruity, then the finish in the back of your throat is of the tea flavor.  It is very mild and nice tasting, again it has a predominantly fruity taste but not overly sweet, it is mild and tastey.<br /><br />Hard to believe this but, I bought two 28 quart cans of this from the 99cent store here in California.  I had never tasted it before that, and there were like 7 cans left (28 quart size) so I bought two thinking that if I didnt like it Id only be out $2.  They expire in June or August of 2013...<br /><br />When I started drinking it I loved it and wished I bought more!  $1 a can that makes 28 quarts!  WOW, what a deal!  I have about 40% of my last can left and I decided to look for more.  But 20 quarts only for about $9 each can?  WOW, that is crazy!  I had no idea!<br /><br />If it is sold by Amazon Im sure the price is good.  The 99 cent store only had those one time only, it is not a regular item (as alot of their merchandise is that way). I shop there frequently to get the best deals, which always go FAST!<br /><br />I hope this review helps, this drink mix tastes pretty good, fruity is the main thing about it with a mild tea after taste.  Also, not too sweet, very nice and refreshing.<br /><br />good luck!"
4,Good but not quite like the real thing,"I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%. While it tastes similar to real avena, the overly processed ingredients give me pause. I will be looking for a recipe for real avena which is probably not that hard to make and a lot healthier.<br /><br />As a sidenote, you can buy this at your local supermarket (in the section of south american foods) in 8 oz containers for half the price."
3,Doesn't have a ton of flavor,When I received this basil there were a few small holes in the bag. They may have been there for a while because the basil doesn't have much flavor. I would recommend spending the few extra dollars and buying direct from Frontier. Thats what I plan on doing in the future.
5,"Dressing good, but beware vendor shipping prices","Got this dressing and others from DAB Nutrition last year, price for shipping was $6.95 total for up to 16 or 17 bottles - a great deal! Now the shipping is still the same for this flavor of dressing only. But if you try to order their other flavors you'll find that they are charging $6.95 PER BOTTLE. Quite a surprise when you see hundreds of dollars show up in your shopping cart. I spoke with Amazon and they told me to get in touch directly with the vendor because the vendor sets the pricing. I spoke with someone at the vendor who told me to get in touch with Amazon. Then she finally told me to email her manager, be brief, and explain the difficulty. I did this and got no response. Caveat emptor, buyer beware."
5,Kona Coffee Lover,"I was looking for a Kona blend  as I can't financially justify the pure Kona coffee. Amazon offered the Magnum Kona Blend and I ordered 2 pounds. I found my first pot too strong using 6 tablespoons for 6 cups as I did with my previous Kona blend. I then went to 5 tablespoons, still too strong. I then went to 4 and that was the winner. So I got the same enjoyment with only 4 tablespoons instead of 6. GOOD DEAL!!!"
5,The best coffee we've had in a very long time.,"My husband and I both like our coffee slightly strong but not bitter. This coffee is very good. If you have a Senseo coffee maker, use the double pod. The pods are very thick."
5,Fast Delivery Good Chili,The chili by its self would only earn about 3 1/2 stars but the fact that they shipped it all the way to the middle of no where for me at no cost makes this a champ.<br /><br />Now if i could only find a bowl in this darn place i wouldn't have to cook it on top the generator's headers lol.
5,YUM!,"I first tasted these crackers at a winery. We bought a couple of bags and brought them home. I liked them so much I just had to go searching for them online and was pleased to be able to buy them. You have to try them.  Can't explain the taste, just very tasty and healthy too!"
5,Delicious AND LOW Sat-Fat,"These are delicious - crunchy, with a nice firm texture and only a faint banana flavor (the fruit loses its sweetness during the drying process, and only added sugar makes it taste like its fresh form).<br /><br />Other banana chips do tend to have a lot of saturated fat.  The Barry Farm chips contain 0.7 grams of sat fat in a one cup serving - which is about half the bag.  They are high carb and high calorie, but they're also high fiber and cholesterol free.  That all seems reasonable to me, provided that you understand that they're a snack and you can't just toss back an entire bag at one sitting.<br /><br />If you want to check out the nutritional information, head over to the Barry Farm website: [...]<br /><br />***EDITED JUNE2012 - I wrote this review in 2008, and Barry Farm has changed the formula for their banana chips in the interim.  They used to be only dried bananas, and now coconut oil is on the ingredients list on their website.  I edited my review to reflect those changes.  Still love 'em, still buy 'em, just wanted to give everyone a heads-up.***"
5,Una Salsa muy Salsa,this in the only way i can get this salsa in japan. thank you very much for providing this product.
2,contains added food dyes,"I loved this when I tried it at Costco...then I read the ingredients.  Contains yellow #5 and #6.  Unbelievable.  Why ruin a good cereal with that crap?  C'mon Quaker, your regular oatmeal is better than this.  Take out the crap and maltodextrin too."
5,The whole family LOVES these snack crisps! Healthy too!,"These fruit crisps are WONDERFUL! A whole pear in one little bag - and a quick and easy snack.  This is a great way to get that ""crunch"" without potato chips or other unhealthy snacks!  My only problem is that I want to eat more than one bag at a time - that can get a little pricy!<br /><br />Great item!"
2,"If you want a flavored coffee, okay... but otherwise YUK",Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.<br /><br />I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk.
5,Great Product,I have been eating pure Maple Syrup for more than 20 years and this is an excellent one that met all of my expectations. I do not think that you will be disappointed. I had it with my pancakes yesterday.
4,Works good but very expensive for the amount you get.,They want you to feed your dog up to 10 a day. With 2 dogs this little container for 10$ will go very fast. I cut my dogs back to 3 a day per dog and it still works.
5,My Favorite Flavor!,"This is my favorite flavor of the primal strips, probably because it's drier and chewier than the other ones.  Some of them can be kind of soft, but the dried shitake gives it a nice chewy flavor, closer to real jerky.  Nice and spicy with a little sweet taste. I actually just finished eating one, so if you're looking for the nutritional info, here it is right off the label:<br /><br />Calories: 108<br />Protein: 6g<br />Fiber: 6g<br />Sugar: 3g<br />Sodium: 334mg<br />Total Fat: 4g, Sat fat: 1g<br /><br />Ingredients: shitake mushrooms, naturally brewed soy sauce, expeller pressed canola oil, licorice root, Non-GMO vital gluten, high fiber soy protein, sea salt, natural vegetarian spices, no MSG added"
5,Probably my favorite Haribo Gummis (to date),"I've been trying a number of the Haribo gummi candies since I found them here on Amazon: grapefruit slices (white and pink), fruit salad, raspberries, golden bears, sugar free bears (intestinal nightmare) and these mini frogs.  No, I don't eat entire 5 lb bags by myself, I take them to work and give my coworkers sugar rushes :)  Of all of them the frogs are what I come back to time and again, and I get the most requests for from my coworkers.  I'm not sure if its the size or the foam, but something about them puts them above the rest in my book.<br /><br />The golden bears are a close second."
5,Tasty,"I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, ""French gray"" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table."
4,"Great product, but someone needs to undercut the price!","This is by far the best sugar-free chocolate I've found. Thanks, Dove! It's rich, creamy, doesn't have the bubble-gum, sugar alcohol taste prevalent in most sugar-free chocolate. One piece is a very satisfying 30 calories.<br /><br />Took off a star for the outrageous price. This is not, at least with the order I placed, specially packaged. I can find this same product in the grocery store for a little over $3 per package, which would be @ $20 or so for six packages. I'm not seeing where the $39 price tag, even adding shipping and handling, comes in. If you can't find this product locally, have no other way to get it and have the bucks to spend, I'd recommend it as a great sugar-free candy. But, it's really too pricey for me to buy it from Amazon again."
5,Great treats!,My boston terrier puppy loves these treats.  Other treats upset his stomach but these are great.  They are wonderful for training due to their moist small size.  I love the natural ingredients too!  Amazon prizes are great for thisw product.  I pay almost double at the pet store.
4,good decaff,This is good decaff...not the best in the world but I'll probably buy it again because of the value. It's a bit weak but all of the Keurig coffees seem to be...guess the flavor is hard to get out when the water is only in contact with the grounds for a second or two.
5,love  it,"This is very high qulity pop corn, I recomend it.  Almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop.  Very healthy and yummy!"
5,This has a fabulous flavor!,"I love pesto and this product meets my desire for strong basil flavor!  There are no pine nuts but those can be added later, after mixing this pesto with your cooked noodles.  However, the jars are really small and the price is relatively high.  I use two jars per half a bag of 'Delicate-Cut Noodles' by Bali-Spice in order to have that strong basil taste.  Maybe San Remo does make a larger jar but I have not seen it on Amazon.  Still...I do recommend this sauce as a delicious change from the usual tomato sauces.  It's quite delectable!!"
5,Excellent substitute for the real thing,"Pudge Free Brownies, recommended to us by a pair of nutritionists, are an excellent substitute for the real thing.  They take care of your craving for a dessert sweet and at the same time they do not hurt you and your low fat diet.  Try baking them in a convection oven for a different taste sensation, too."
4,Very Good....,"I thought I ordered hulled so I was a bit surprised with un-hulled, however the product is great as described.  My mistake.  I make my own tihini by grinding up the seeds in the food processor.  The hulled work much better if you like raw tihini.  I don't have to add anything to the seeds.  It is a little thicker than the type you buy already processed but it is exactly like the raw tihini purchased fresh in the health food market. This product works as well but is much thicker and has more fiber."
5,best mango flavor ever,"if you like gummy bears and are looking for mango flavored, then this is it.  My family loves these gummies.  the best anywhere... I did my homework, trust me.  I'm a candy freak!!!"
2,cheese puffs,"i couldnt even give these away, i served them at a party<br />and when it was all over the bowl was still full, i offered bags<br />to guests leaving, and not one person excepted. hard and weird taste"
1,False advertising at its best,Take a look at the picture on the box and what do you see?  Big chunks of paneer and some liquid.  Well that's not what's in the box.  There are a few pieces of paneer and about 90% liquid with fat pooling on the surface.  This was a completed disappointment and I have 9 boxes to go.  Tasty Bite entrees are much better.  I don't care if this is the #1 brand in India - it's near the bottom of my list.
5,"smooth, tasty chocolate with no sugar!","I'm delighted to find this organic 100% chocolate bar at Amazon since my local natural food store does not carry it & for some reason cannot special order for me. I have been eating 100% chocolate for several years now. Although this bar is a little thick for eating out-of-hand, overall it's quite nice & affordable as an every-day chocolate. Not the baking chocolate I remember from my childhood! Smooth, creamy, with a lovely mouth feel & finish. Would recommend to anyone looking to get their chocolate fix without the hazard of sugar. If you are weaning yourself from chocolate candy, I can recommend eating this half-and-half with a nice 75 or 80%  bar and gradually increasing the 100% as your tastebuds adjust. It's worth the effort!"
5,Great!,"This product was shipped in a very timely manner and is exactly what was advertised.  I was very grateful for the quick turnaround time, and as it worked out - it was so much cheaper than my local vitamin store!  Thanks so much!"
5,Its The Best Quality So Far,"I have been using Spectrums brand for a year now. I use it for hair, cooking, oil pulling, as a body moisturizer, and as a air fresher in my oil burner. Recently I made the mistake of trying other brands. I will never do that again. I'm from the islands so I know the true quality of unrefined coconut oil. I promise Spectrums Unrefined coconut oil is honestly the best quality, texture, and organic scent. I will never venture out again."
5,Fancy Feast from Amazon is best,"My little kitty cats, well maybe I shouldn't say little as my Maine Koon weighs 25 pounds, but my sweet little spoiled darlings will only eat Fancy Feast and in particular, salmon and shrimp grilled.  Sometimes they will eat other Fancy Feast but this one is their all time favorite.  And believe me, they know how to get what they want.  The auto delivery is wonderful from Amazon because I don't have to go shopping and lug cat food home.  Great.  Sharon Dalrymple"
5,MMMEEEEEEOOOOWWWW!!,"Let me start here by admitting that we have 5 cats that live with us now (I know, don't even ask it's a loooong story).  I've always been a big fan of the Fancy Feast and recently the fishier varieties of the Aristocats soft foods.  On occasion I will purchase Friskies but honestly I just can't stand the smell of the latter, even if the kitties just love it.<br /><br />Just for a fun little test I decided to put three cans out, to see which was favored by my cats (Fancy Feast, Aristocats and this Petite Cuisine).  Well, long story short, they gobbled this brand up, quick as quick before moving on to their usual favorites.<br /><br />This brand looks and for the most part smells similar to canned tuna, one of them even has tiny whole shrimp. Bonus!! They eat it all up, so no kitty food sitting in the bowl when they are done. It is made from quality ingredients, not full of ash (like some), has added vitamins and the texture & smell that the cats really enjoy.  I admit that quality cat food has gotten a bit on the expensive side but, this isn't bad at all considering the prices of the other comparable brands.  All in all my kitties really enjoyed this food & I will certainly be back for more."
1,Splenda - What a horrible idea,"This drink should get ZERO stars.<br /><br />My husband and I recently purchased the Tassimo Suprema machine.  We mainly drink cappuccinos, but we were excited about some of the other drink options.  To add variety to our selection, we tried the Twinings Chai Latte T discs.  I was the first one to taste the chai latte.  I looked at my husband immediately and remarked, ""It tastes like it has Splenda in it!"" We were both incredulous at first, but then he tasted it as well.  It did taste like it had Splenda.  I took the packaging out of the garbage and read the ingredients of the Twinings Chai Latte.  To our very severe disappointment, the very last ingredient was sucralose.  My husband and I detest Splenda - it has an awful aftertaste and it gives us headaches.  We are extremely disappointed that Tassimo/Twinings decided to put Splenda in the Chai Latte recipe. We did not purchase our Tassimo system because we wanted low calorie drinks - and if the product contains Splenda IT SHOULD CLEARLY SAY SO ON THE PACKAGE. Furthermore, we are perplexed why, if this one product contains Splenda, there is no other Chai latte option.  Why in the world would someone want to spoil the wonderful taste of Chai with a manufactured sugar substitute like Splenda?  If customers ASK for a low calorie substitute, it should definitely be made available.  But why make your only version ""low calorie?""<br /><br />We cannot bring ourselves to finish the rest of the package that we purchased - it tastes so awful. We're very disappointed that the money we spent on the package of Chai Latte T discs was wasted.  If we had seen on the packaging that it contained Splenda we would not have purchased it - we automatically assume that the sweetener is not artificial unless the label indicates otherwise - all customers do.<br /><br />Of course, if you don't mind the taste of Splenda then you might really enjoy this drink.  Otherwise, spend your money on something else - and make sure you read the ingredients before you buy it!"
4,Amazingly filling for a bar.,These were really good. I didn't really taste any peanut butter which is why it didn't get 5 stars. Also it's a little pricey. But for snack or breakfast they are really quite satisfying. And since it's all natural and gluten free they are great for anybody.
5,"Dogs get bored with treats, they like variety, too","This bucket of assorted dog treats is a real hit at our house.  Full of muscle chews, pizzle sticks, sausage treats, jerky, both beef and chicken, etc.  I can grab a handful, throw it around the house, and dogs are entertained for hours of chewing pleasure.  Best of all, they're low-fat."
5,better than Starbucks,Of the several brands I've tried this is the best one. It has a richer vanilla flavor than any other. Great in coffee or egg creams :-)
3,Junk food for picky dogs,"I can't/won't feed this to my own dogs because of food allergies, and there's the mysterious ""animal fat"" and ""animal digest"" in this ingredient list which makes me a little nervous about which animal it came from.  Really, the ingredient list is terrible, it's a bunch of leftover food waste products made into dog food.  Beef is the first ingredient in the list, but when you add up all the forms of soy, corn, and wheat in the ingredient list, there's more junk in this dog food than beef.<br /><br />*BUT*, my family's dog is a picky eater and this Chef Michael's dog food is perfect for her because she's used to treats and flavorful table scraps (bad, bad habit that I don't approve of) and she snubs healthier kibbles.  Salt makes this kibble tasty.  With the ingredient list, this kibble reminds me of salted kinda-meaty Cheetos, complete with unnecessary food colorings.<br /><br />For my own dogs, this would be a 1-star food (honestly, I think this is junk and overpriced too for what it is), but this food does have its uses if you don't really mind what's in it and you have a picky dog and need extra flavorings to entice them to eat dry dog food."
1,Dried out and hard - threw it away!  How old is your stock?,"Clarification - my review was from gum purchased from ""The Candy Company"". I have no experience with other suplliers.<br /><br />DON'T BUY!<br /><br />Used to love this stuff when we were kids, were excited to find it still available!  REALLY disappointed we we opened the first pack to find the liquid center totally dried out and the gum itself hard and old.  Open all the packs - same thing.  Threw the whole thing away in disgust, should have sent it back for a refund of my $10."
4,Shorted on the product,"Do you need to review Jell-O?  Normally no; but this is a special case.<br /><br />I ordered one 24-pack of the peach sugar-free Jell-O.  Of those 24 boxes, three were empty!  No inside envelope, and of course no product.<br /><br />While Amazon has always made good on any problem I've had, I felt that complaining about three boxes of Jell-O was really not worthy anybody's time.  However I did want to write this review so that others might be wary.  My suggestion: do as I will do from now on - check all boxes and let Amazon know if their customers are getting ripped-off, and then write your review to indicate the problem.  Eventually, the manufacturer will find that bad reviews don't help sales very much."
5,Yummy!,"Was craving grilled cheese and tomato soup and came across this at the supermarket. Delicious. I added a little salt and black pepper but otherwise this soup is awesome. Chunky tomatoes really make this soup a winner. I came to Amazon hoping to get more but at $2.88 a can, might as well get it in store. I paid $2.69."
5,Yummy and fun!  A crowd pleaser!,"Whenever I have guests over, I offer them a glass of Butterfinger cocoa.  They love it!  It really is fantastic!  My local grocer is no longer stocking this so I was SO happy to find it on Amazon!  Great deal!"
5,Soooo good,Perfect potful packets are a great way to go ... each package is pre-measured to make one full pot of coffee.  No guesswork on how much or little to use.  Creme Brule is an excellent choice and makes a very smooth and delicious drink
5,Best Tahini I've had!,"Having lived in the Middle East for 10 years, our family loves hummos and we make a lot of it.  This is the best brand I've ever found in the U.S.  I like the taste and the texture of this one, and it mixes wonderfully with the other ingredients.  I found it somewhere locally, then when I went to buy more I couldn't find it again.  Krinos is so much better than all the brands you find in health food stores or supermarkets, and the price happens to be about half of what most stores charge for a similar amount of tahini.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon!"
4,check expiration date!,"Just a cautionary note: I bought the 50 pack this summer, and just noticed that they packs expire at the end of November 2010. If you are a fast and furious VIA drinker this would not be a problem, but I only drink them at work, etc etc. I actually find a whole packet to be too strong; I prefer to use half a packet per cup, which is cheaper of course, and allows you to justify the occasional splurge on the ""real thing""."
5,LOVE IT!,I love this product...hard to find this flavor in the store and with amazon's great prices and fast delivery...i will keep on ordering...thank you amazon!!
4,Good earth-friendly coffee but too much packaging,"I am a coffee lover and usually enjoy a strong cappuccino in the morning.  I tried this coffee and was impressed by the aroma and flavor.  It is not too strong but has a good not-too bitter flavor.  I really like the pods - so much less mess but these are all individually wrapped!  I know a lot of coffee pods/packets are to keep in the freshness but maybe organic and fair-trade coffee manufacturers could care a little more about the waste produced from individually wrapped items.  Needless to say, I did enjoy my cup of coffee and would buy this product again."
5,Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food,"We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes. He looked like he was on his last leg, the cat not my brother-in-law. Anyway, we started supplementing his food with Newman's Own and I swear the cat looks 2 years younger. He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better. I am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a Vet has suggested. But if you have an animal who is not responding well, it is worth a try to add this product to their diet."
5,"Excellent product,","you will love this on your chicken, weither it's on the grill or in a skillet,<br />you will use it everytime.  and you can also use it a season in different chicken dishes."
5,Best Ever Cookie,I bought two cases of the Pecan Shortbread cookies since I can't find them in the grocery store anymore. The other flavors are not so good. These are a great value when you combine with free shipping. They have a very good taste and you wouldn't even guess that they are a gluten free cookie. My shipment arrived unbroken but I have bought in the store and they were crumbs. I love this product.
3,Other flavours are better,"Of the three Amoretti syrups I've ordered, this one is the least appealing. I can't quite put my finger on it -- it's not bad, but the flavour profile and aftertaste are a little off. The caramel and vanilla syrups are excellent, though, and I plan on trying the hazelnut one too. Higher-quality overall than Torani's offerings."
5,Excellent - Hard To Find,"Until recently, Johnnie Walker Double Black was only available in duty free airport stores. About a year ago I purchased my first bottle in duty free. Johnnie Walker has now released this to select liquor stores.<br /><br />This is very similar to Black Label, but with an added punch of more smoke and stronger more pronounced flavors. It has a much sharper edge than Black Label. This stands up to ice rather well.<br /><br />Because it was so rare, Double Black developed a mystique. This is a good blended Scotch, but it isn't worth trekking all over to find. If your local liquor store carries it, it is well worth a try.<br /><br />I happen to like Double Black a bit better than straight Black Label. I'm a big fan of the smokier Scotches, Lagavulin, Scapa, Laphroaig, and others from Islay. I like Green Label a lot more than either Black Label. Of all the Johnnie Walkers, I dislike Gold Label, and, of course, Blue Label is my favorite. One of the primary single malts used in Johnnie Walker blends is Cardhu.<br /><br />If you can find it, this is a lovely Scotch."
5,Why eat out ?!?  This stuff is GREAT !!,"I spent a year living in New Delhi, and developed quite a fondness for Indian food.  This is as close as I have *ever* come to recreating the restaurant fare at home.  Easy to use, reasonable price, and the quality and taste are VERY VERY GOOD.<br /><br />Highly recommend."
5,Perfect solution for pet meds!,"My 14 year old plus senior dog takes as many meds as a senior owner might and more often than not it was challenging to get her to take the pill.  Not anymore!  She treats the meds as though they are treats thanks to pill pockets.  The product is pliable like putty so one ""pocket"" can be used for several individual pills. A great, great product!"
5,Beware No More!,"If you're willing to order FOUR 12-quart packages of this product, presumably you're already familiar with it and don't need a review to validate your purchase decision. My primary purpose in posting this review, therefore, is simply to rebut the previously posted, unfair one-star review which addressed a customer service issue rather than the product itself. Although it's certainly valid to raise such issues, I don't think it should impact the PRODUCT ranking, so I've given this item the five-star rating I believe it rightfully deserves.<br /><br />That said, I will make a few additional comments.<br /><br />I ordered this item via ""Subscribe & Save"" and received it in three days. The FOUR canisters come in a pre-packaged (and sealed) plastic bag marked ""Ready for shipping,"" which would seem to ensure that you'll always get the right amount.<br /><br />The price was recently reduced, making the per unit cost comparable to what you'll probably find in your local grocery store (assuming you can find this flavor).<br /><br />If you're a long-time Crystal Light consumer, you'll really appreciate the new, more ""user friendly"" packaging; the canisters are easier to store, and both the canister and individual tubes/packets (not tubs) are easier to open."
4,A fine and sturdy everyday tea,"This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores (and Cost Plus World Market) stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag. I drink my tea black, but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Cognoscenti typically prefer loose tea. Tea bags contain the less expensive ""fannings"" or ""dust,"" remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), many people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />However, if you like I sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea."
5,Splenda Great Deal,"I ordered Splenda online from Amizon.  Price was much better than in local store and it was delivered promptly to our door.  Thanks for great deal and service.<br /><br />  Rich and Patricia Armstrong  Virginia Beach, Va"
4,Good balance and she likes it,"Tender vittles, as colorful as a box of kids' cereal, this really enticing food.  The dog really likes it.  She eats a full bowl and leaves just a little.  True, she's more excited about eating the long-dead fish down at the lake, but I'm definitely more excited about this food.  I haven't served this to her for very long to say whether it affects her health positively or negatively, but I did have a dog whose hair would fall out if he ate corn.  I like that this food has alot of different food groups, not just meat... dogs are omnivorous like humans.  Some dogs don't handle grains well, but if she can handle it well in the long-term, this is probably the food I would choose to keep buying for her.  Except for the food coloring--please--if they love stinky fish, do they care what color the food is?"
3,I'm Just Not Addicted...,"With so many other glowing reviews, I feel a little ashamed to put my own lukewarm review in.  Kashi GoLean Crunch! has 7 whole grains in it, which means puffed rice is mixed with oats and rye and other grains to make clusters.  It's naturally sweetened, which is a plus, and it definitely stays crunchy in milk.  Really, really crunchy.  It has sort of a sweet, oat-slightly-nutty flavor to it, and it's not bad.<br /><br />However, as I said, I'm not really addicted to it.  I prefer Back to Nature Granolas, and as I wrote this review, I became curious as to their nutrition facts.  So here is the Kashi measured up against the Back to Nature All-Natural Granola, Apple Blueberry, 15-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) - measured by 1/2 cup servings.  There are definitely more calories in BTN (200 vs. 95), but there's fruit too, which the Kashi GoLean lacks.  BTN has slightly less sugar (6 g to Kashi's 6.5g), less salt (20 mg to 47.5 mg) and there's more protein in it (6 g to Kashi's 4.5g). They are equal in the following categories: dietary fiber (4g) and calcium (2%); there's more fat in BTN (2.5g=4% BTN, 1.5g=2.5% Kashi).  So there is not a lot of difference between the two.<br /><br />But as for the taste and the texture?  I'd readily take granola any day over the Kashi.  I don't like overly crunchy cereals (why buy a cereal specifically named, ""Crunch!"" right?) and the granola is crisp enough for me.  There are fewer sharp edges to stab me in the gums."
5,Working great for my girls,"I purchased Now! Senior/Light last week in an effort to get one of my Bichon girl's very high triglycerides down.<br />IT's been a week feeding this food and her triglycerides are back to normal!  Also, a bonus is she likes it plain with nothing mixed in, and stool is firm and nearly no smell!<br /><br />Thanks for a great product!"
5,Yoli,I love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them. These are the only chips I eat
5,Great Tasting Tea,I really enjoy this Green Tea. Has great taste and not too strong. I see others have found this bitter but that is not what I find.  I love Green Tea more than any other tea but sometimes it is hard to find in the K-cups.  Have been using various green teas for years and I find this to be one of the best!  It is currently available on Subscribe & Save.
5,leagues better than American,"My husband and I eat this every morning and never tire of it.  Leagues better than American oatmeal ... wish we could get somebody here to start milling oatmeal this way.  We call our morning bowl the oatmeal souffle.  Not gluey.  Light and delicious.  I adapt the recipe on package to 1/3 cp oat flakes per serving, with one cp water.  Always soak first or cook to boiling at medium.  If you get distracted and it thickens too much add a bit more boiling water, cook a minute or two longer, and serve.  Lowers cholesterol; great source of fiber."
5,Delicious!!!,"I love orange blossom honey and have a hard time trying to find it... this stuff is DELICIOUS!! Good price, fast shipping. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Review: KIND Nuts and Spices: Madagascar Vanilla no less!,"In the interest of full disclosure...I'm not a huge nut fan.  Usually, I will skip brownies, cakes and other items that have nuts in them.  I'm willing to eat them by themselves but I find they kind of ruin other thing people stick them into.  Further, I'm trying to lose weight and usually nuts can be a good way to go.<br /><br />The KIND Nuts and Spices nut bars are part of the KIND Healthy Snacks line.  They are very upfront about pointing out the use of only 5 grams of sugar (or less) and nothing artificial.  further internet research shows that they keep the sugar levels low by using spices.  In this case, its Madagascar vanilla.<br /><br />The bars are very tasty, not too heavy and rather filling for what volume they take up.  They are a little sticky (the plastic wrap they come is is surprisingly strong) and the bars themselves really do taste well for the amount of sugar.<br /><br />I will point out that the bars I had boasted 16g of fat, 14 g of carbs, 5 g dietary fiber and 7 grams of protein.  From Weight Watchers standpoint, that's 6 points.  Having said that, I could see one of these bars being a decent substitute for a meal so from that standpoint, its cheap points wise.<br /><br />All in all, the bar is pretty good...I'm glad I got them and I will buy more!"
4,"A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course","My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible.<br /><br />But lord help me, I try.<br /><br />I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted crap.<br /><br />(Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure.<br /><br />The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!)<br /><br />I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.)<br /><br />And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag.<br /><br />So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner."
5,A great decaf,Have ordered this before and coming back for more.  A great full flavored decaf with lots of body.  Would not hesitate to order it again. Highly recommended!
5,Camping tradition at its best,"What do you think of foodwise when you go camping? well besides the case of beer, you have the dogs and the marshmallows! Nothing like roasting these suckers over an open fire, or just pop them in your mouth from the bad. Soft, and fluffy, these suckers don't get hard and stale as quickly as other brands do. Definately a great product."
5,Delicious!,"This is a fantastic syrup, with wonderful flavor.  The price is great when you subscribe to the ""subscribe and save"".  Pure maple syrup doesn't give me sugar highs and lows the way other sweeteners can.  It is said to be a balanced sweetener.  I love it!  My kids love it!"
5,Excellent as Mini-Donuts - buy only from Amazon Sub & Save for...,"...the best value - another vendor now shows nearly as triple for a 12 pack.<br /><br />Made as mix - less one egg - milk instead of water - in this:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00519AOF6"">Sunbeam FPSBDMM921 Mini Donut Maker</a><br />Makes a total 8 batches - using only a TEASPOON to avoid overflow as shown in my previous pix upl'd - sooooooooooooooooo very goooooooooooooood - warm and serve with crushed berries [and whipping cream optional] ANY time of the day.<br /><br />AND even better as a Mini dessert when topped with this: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041O6WUS"">Betty Crocker Rich & Creamy Frosting, Triple Chocolate Fudge Chip, 15.5-Ounce Containers (Pack of 8)</a>"
5,YUMM!,"LOVE these potatoes, they're so good & can be made quickly<br />the finished product is non-lumpy & tastes great<br />they work in the stovetop or in the microwave just as well<br />I will be making them again when the weather cools"
5,Great cup of Green Tea,"This is really a great little green tea. The flavor of the green tea comes through even with the sweetness from the gojiberry and pomegranate seeds. Enjoyed this very much hot, and can see that it would be excellant served over ice.<br /><br />Since Green tea loose leaves can be brewed more than one time, decided to see how it would stand up to a second brewing. The flavors still came through strong so I went for a third brewing and still was very statisfied with the flavor profile.<br /><br />Excellant loose leaf tea. Will be purchasing more of this in the future."
5,SHHH - Don't let them know these are good for them.,My 2 MinPins love these chews. They each get one of the small size every morning after their walk and will drive me nuts until they get them. Their teeth are very clean and their breath doesn't smell either. I buy them by the case from Value Pet Supplies. Really nice people to do business with.
5,Great Chew Treat,Greenies are the special treat we give our golden retriever and great pyrenee/golden retriever mix.  Greenies are hard enough that our dogs have to chew slowly but not so hard that I feel uncomfortable giving it to them.
5,Just what I needed!,"Well, thanks to the internet, what was once available at Brick & Mortar stores is long gone. So, amazon it was. These vials were the right price and the right colour glass (I needed clear, NOT amber or blue) so I ordered them, with fingers crossed.<br /><br />Arrived very, very fast (only days via USPS) and very well-packaged. SCORE!!!! What I'm using them for is sharing extremely expensive spices and flavoured oils (Fiori di Sicilia and White Truffle oil, for example) with friend's who can't afford the full-sized item. These luxury food items last forever because you use them in such small amounts but cost an arm and a leg to buy the original packaging. So, I'm ""sharing the wealth"" with beloved friends so they can also try these lovely flavours but don't have to spring for the Big Bucks. From oils, to food powders (Vermont Cheese/Vietnamese Cinnamon) to several gourmet salts, these vials are just the right size for my friends to get a good taste and decide if they want or need more, in the larger containers. If they do, I automatically will have future gifts for them which I know they'll cherish rather than go ""ick""! LOL<br /><br />Nice way to share the bounties you have with those you love. &lt;3"
5,Great for kids!,My kids love these and I can feel good about giving the Pops to them because they are organic and packed with vitamin C! A must have for any mom!
4,Very tasty!,"This quick bread is really easy to make even though it does require extras to be added.....2 eggs and 1/2 cup of melted butter and water.  It cooks up fast and easy and tastes great.  It's a bit on the heavy side...sort of like pound cake with very few poppy seeds but it's truly enjoyable.  I would recommend it for an occassional treat but a lot of butter is used so I wouldn't suggest daily intake of it.  Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it too."
5,Unbelievable,"I love a really good dark chocolate, and even more so when it has fruit and nuts in it.  This one is by far the best fruit and nut chocolate bar I've ever had.  Just opening the package the aroma of fruit is splendid - however a square in your mouth is heaven!  So delicious.  I'm hooked.  I know this one's new, I hope it never goes away!"
5,awesome,I can not get this product where I live so I always order this from Taylors Market! Awesome service!!! THANKS!!!!!!!
5,My dogs love these!,"I got these for my chihuahuas and all three of them love them! They seem to be easier to chew than rawhide, and I'm not as afraid of them choking! I wish they had more flavors- but I'm sure they will in time!"
5,Excellent Dog Treat,"My ultra finicky American Eskimo dog, Precious, loves these treats. I buy this brand because they are manufactured in the US not China. Originally I bought the duck jerky PetsMart carried, which was from China and it made Precious extremely ill. Now I only buy treats made in the US or Canada. These particular treats are best for smaller size dogs, big dogs would probably gulp them down instead of chewing them up."
5,Excellent coffee,No bitter test even though it makes a strong cup of coffee. Rich and Creamy. will buy again as soon as Amazon start selling it not through the third party.
5,Positively addictive!,"I love this popcorn.  It's super crunchy and sprinkled with delicious nuts.  I was looking for a low calorie snack and found this.  I'm glad I did.  However, I haven't paid much  attention to its calorie count since it's so good I don't really care.  I haven't noticed any weight gain so maybe it's a good substitute for peanut m&m's, another addiction of mine."
5,Tasty chips,"I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.<br /><br />Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1"" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.<br /><br />These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself."
5,sweet costco,"I love this coffee and I love Amazon.  That being said, Costco sells the exact same item for $33.00.  How can I cheat on Amazon?????"
5,My kids favorite!,"We love these bars at my house. My kids (including 2 picky young children) could eat them all day long if I let them! They're not too fond of the berry flavor but this one, chocolate, is a big hit. They're just the right size to toss into a lunch box too and aren't messy. They're easy to chew too so even my 2 year old can enjoy them."
1,Disappointing,"This bag was a real disappointment.  It was tiny.  Not just small, but tiny.  It did not have a whole lot of candy in it and that seems ridiculous considering the price.  I paid $15.83 for both the candy and shipping together (8.49+7.34S).  At the local store I could have gotten the same bag for $2.75 (at Vons) and at another store (Albertsons) I could have gotten TWO 48 oz bags (5 times the 18oz size) for the price available here.  Do yourself a favor and get something else.  This is just not worth the price Candy Corner is asking.<br /><br />As for the candy itself, this particular mix was disappointing.  No Nerds, which is the favorite among all the kids.  No Pixie Stix, no Fun Dip, no Runts.  It did have a couple of nice ones, but also a couple that no one wanted.  And the bottle caps did not taste right and certainly not how they usually taste.  If they haven't changed the way they make them, then it is possible they were stale.<br /><br />I hope this helps you avoid overpriced candy."
5,tastes great!,"This brand of pasta is easy to cook, and taste great. My children can't tell the difference between it and wheat pasta."
5,Crowd pleaser,"My five Cavalier King Charles Spaniels love Wet Noses.  The organic,limited ingredient treats give me peace of mind that I'm providing them safe and healthful ingredients. Buying Wet Noses products through Amazon is more affordable than the pet stores, too."
5,finally!,"i've searched high and low for a delicious, healthy, meatless jerky product.  i'm a pescatarian, so tuna/salmon/halibut jerky is great, but super expensive and often incredibly high in sodium.  i found these in the aisles of pcc and absolutely fell in love.  first thing i did was search amazon for them, and here they were!  the price is better, and i knew i would eat these every day.  i take two to work and have at least one at home.  i would recommend these to anyone, carnivore or vegan, looking for a delicious, healthy source of protein.  wow!"
5,So yummy !!!!!,My favorite flavor of kind bar.  The dark chocolate is not too sweet and the fruity/nutty textures and flavors really shine.  A very healthy splurge !!!
5,AlphisNumberOneFan,My dog Alphi loves this healthy treat.  Amazon offers a great price.  I highly recommend this product if your dog is finicky.
5,Cat loves it,"Our cat loves this formula.  I'm happy that the primary ingredients are actual meat, rather than grains.  Cats are carnivores, after all.  Our cat has had many less problems with hairballs and weight gain as well."
5,My favorite snack that's tasty and nutritious!,"Somersaults not only pack in 6 g of protein & 3 g of fiber (a powerful mix), they are also downright tasty!  And the cocoa version - come on.  It satisfies my sweet tooth and gives me nutrition.  Can't beat that.  These have absolutely become our favorite snack, hands down."
4,Better than expected,"I had already tried two Clear Scalp & Hair products and was less than impressed with the results.  In fact, I noticed a difference after just one use-and not in a good way.<br /><br />This product however was much better.  The conditioner helped restore the moisture that the Clear Scalp & Hair Moisture shampoo had striped away.  I also used the Clear Scalp & Hair Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil which added a lot of shine.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone with long hair (long hair is old hair-the closer to the scalp the younger the hair), curly hair or thick & coarse hair because the shea butter adds the moisture that your hair needs but it doesn't make your hair greasy or weighed down.  If you have thin or fine hair I would try a volumizing formula instead."
4,Great crackers,These are great crackers. Yes they are made of seeds and are extremely crunchy. If you don't like seeds why would you buy these (I am pretty sure the description of the crackers is clear)? I like the onion flavor and like other flavors from Mary's Gone Crackers.
5,Very Pleasant ... Bold and Smooth!,Great Coffee ... I like my coffee strong - finally found one that has a wonderful full flavor without the bitterness.
5,best coffee,the best tasting dark roast for the Kurieg I can find.<br /><br />Rev and Revv 2 are a bit too much caffeine aftertaste but they are also worth looking into for that morning when you cant get going.
5,Best licorice out there - hands down,"These things are $6 a bag in my local grocery store - finding them here for around $4 a bag was a great find. This is the softest, juiciest licorice you'll ever find. I'm addicted to it, and I'm really glad to've found an online source for it."
5,Awesome Popcorn,Orville's is the best microwave popcorn you can buy...in my opinion.  The price is outstanding from Amazon and we have compared it all around at various stores.  Almost all the kernels pop and we love the movietheatre butter flavor!<br />Cannot go wrong with this purchase.
5,The best basmati rice we've found,"We eat a lot of basmati rice and the Royal brand is our favorite.  It has a superior flavor and aroma over the other basmatis we've tried, and the grains cook up so much nicer and fluffier.<br /><br />To truly appreciate this fine rice, I would highly recommend following the directions to rinse the rice first.  It DOES make a difference."
2,Try a Box Before Buying a Case - a review of BTN's Mac & Cheese,"I like organic. We do organic milk and meat, and vegetables when we can afford the latter. My children like macaroni and cheese - not my homemade casserole, of course (lol), but out of a box. (Reasons for this preference are unknown.)<br /><br />In any case, you would think organic *Back to Nature Macaroni & Cheese* would be popular at our house but it's not. Simple put, my children won't eat it.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because of the lack of chemicals that the cheese sauce comes out a little grainy. Or maybe I just made it wrong, but my testy tikes won't gobble this down like non-organic, over-processed wheat Kraft Mac.<br /><br />Two Stars. Maybe I just had a bad box. Or maybe I just didn't make it right that day, but my two (boy and girl) would not eat this macaroni and cheese product. If you are going to try it (products do get IMPROVED every day) then my advice would be to buy ONE box and try it; and not a case."
2,Disappointed in coffee choice,"On the recommendation of someone else's review which said this coffee was mild, I chose to purchase a box.  It is still stronger than I like.  I have to use much creamer and sugar, plus run more water through a second time.  Not what i hoped for.  Sorry.<br /><br />Would like a truly mild tasting coffee, there were some in the first sample box I bought, but the next two sample boxes had too many strong coffees and many tea cups.  I already have a good selection of tea, etc and only wanted coffee samples.  Am not sure how to find a coffee to my taste without a lot of waste."
5,Diamond Hazelnuts,This is a great way to stock up on produce from out of area. Good deal at a great price.
5,My favorite,Excellent cinnamon flavor. It keeps me going all year long especially when Starbucks runs out of my pumpkin spice. It is my favorite flavor and brand. I did have to order it<br />on-line because I only found it once at a store. It's a seasonal type of an item so on-line works best.
5,the best treat,This is the first dog treat I've bought that my dogs actually fight over. They love them.
5,Awesome Recovery Tools,"I had my reservations about this product when I first saw this product.  But being a big fan of Jelly Belly I had to try them.  I've used this product off and on for two years now.  I has helped me recover from training sessions.  Long runs, cross fit sessions, and field exercises that would have left me dehydrated for the day just become ""fond"" memories after taking one of these packs.  I do not recommend eating these Jelly Bellies unless your body needs the electrolytes, they taste too sweet and salty."
5,they really taste like tea!,these green tea kit kats are delicious! when it was delivered on friday i didnt wake up early enough to get it so i had to pick it up from the post office on monday. before i put them in the fridge to get cold i had to try one! the chocolate was melted alittle bit to the paper but either way they were good! im gonna buy more when i get some money! thanks!
5,Yum,These came early! Wonderful! WIll order from again! Great in tea! I gave a pack to my grandmother and she loves them too!
5,chocolate decadence,My husband was just diagosed with type 2 diabetes.  I am gluten intolerant and my daughter gave me the simply lite bars for Christmas.  My husband is now hooked on them but Wal-mart has discontinued.  We bought all they had.  They are soooo chocolatey - it has saved my husband from his m&m and peppermint pattie addiction.  Hopefully amazon will carry these soon so we can purchase in bulk!!
5,"Love this tea, my favorite...","I have tried many decaf green teas, and this one is my favorite.  Really nice flavor! Next time I will order the 40-bag/6 boxes from Amazon as I am going through the 20-bag/6 boxes too quickly.  Great price too."
4,"Tasty, but like others better","This is a tasty bar, but as it contains chocolate it isn't great for all occasions, like a breakfast snack, and to me isn't chocolatey enough to satisfy those type of dessert cravings.<br />It's still WAY better than other healthy chocolate fruit/nut bars."
5,Tastes great! Perfect snack!,I love these bars! They are an excellent snack and taste great wwith a cup of herbal tea. They have more calories (210) than some of the other choices (such as Oskri Granola bars which have 145 calories). But they are well worth the few extra calories. I highly recommend them!
5,Good peppers,"Delivery was good, and the peppers were all whole and in good condition. Pull off the stem and throw in a coffee-type grinder and you're in business."
5,Easier to Use than Standard Vacu Vin,"I have used both this product and the standard (cheaper) Vacu-Vin...pay the premium and buy this product, as it is SUBTANTIALLY easier to use.<p>In addition to being more stylish than the standard Vacu Vin, the stoppers on this product are easier to use and the pumping mechanism &quot;clicks&quot; when you have pumped enough air out of the wine bottle...the standard model just leaves you guessing about how much air has been removed."
3,"I love Popchips, but I don't love this flavor","As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips."
5,Fantastic product,Great!  My dogs beg for them.  One won't even finish his dinner because he wants his Nutri Dent.  Much longer lasting than those new formula Greenies.
5,Chocolate Lab Puppy,My chocolate lab puppy is killing this product.  His 8 week visit he was 11 lbs and yesterday i took him for his 10 week appt and he is now 16.1 lbs.  Thanks pinnacle!<br /><br />Update dog is now 7 months and still on product he is still loving this food and acts like it is filet everytime.
5,El Salvador Dali,"This is a smooth and fairly mild coffee that has very mild hints of coco berries and marshmallows (not overpowering, just a hint). It's my personal favorite. Love this coffee."
3,Interesting flavor combination,"I occasionally add powdered flavoring to try to encourage myself to drink more water.  While I'm not a big fan of green tea flavoring, I do enjoy the tastes of honey, blackberries, and pomegranates.  While that combination of flavors sounds interesting, I really did not enjoy the final result. I think my taste buds were a bit confused.  It might be nice to try this if you love all the flavorings listed, but I will stick to the more basic flavors."
2,Beware of possible damaged goods,"Well, this is frustrating as I really love this product for making decent quality lattes on my home machine. However, this is the second time in a row where the product has arrived damaged with cartons opened/punctured with leaky milk. It is hard to know what caused the damaged cartons as the original box is packed in a larger box with paper around it. I am thinking that because I am an Amazon Preferred customer, the orders are shipped via 2-day air. Maybe the air pressure in flight is causing packaging to fail. Fortunately, Amazon has been very good about dealing with the situation, but as I said it is frustrating not having good soy to make decent foam."
2,Huh?,"After reading many of the reviews for this instant coffee, I thought I'd try some.  It tastes exactly like every other instant coffee - no better, no worse.  I was expecting more based on the reviews.  I'll keep looking."
5,A family favorite,"I buy three different flavors of KIND bars. These are the ones that disappear the soonest so I have had to double up the order. What's not to like?<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034EFIPQ"">KIND Fruit & Nut, Almond & Apricot, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a> They are delicious, healthy, reasonable priced, portable. My husband and my son do alot of strenuous, physical work. They both love KIND bars for the energy they provide. I highly recommend them over most any choice available. In fact I recently gave one to my mailman since he delivers them for Amazon. He loved it too."
5,No more inisulin,"Our cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  Our vet prescribed 5 units of insulin.  He was supposed to have his blood checked at the vet's once a month and we were to buy their expensive high protein, high fiber kibbles.  I went on the net and found a book here on Amazon written by Elizabeth M. Hodgkins (she is a vet and an attorney) called Your Cat: New Secrets to a Longer Stronger life.  She recommended home testing, which we did morning and night for about a month, and only fed him Wellness cat food because she said a diabetic cat needs a canned high protein food with no grains and absolutely no kibbles.  We are now testing him once a week and only feeding him Wellness Adult Chicken Canned Cat Food  He has been off insulin with normal blood sugar readings for a little over two months!"
3,Vanilla wafers -- beware they can melt in shipment!!!,"These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!"
4,Baby loved it!,Will buy again in the future...my baby girl (11 months) loved it! Great thicker food for babies learning to eat chunkier textures.
5,Delicious!,"KIND PLUS Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio bars are very delicious.  I enjoy one bar and a glass of orange/carrot juice every morning.  Dr Oz recommends that you eat protein within the first hour after waking; you will get protein from this bar.  I really love the fresh taste and texture.  2012 UPDATE: I usually get bored with food, but not these bars!  I still have my juice and this Pom/Blue/Pistach bar every single morning for breakfast.  I don't kind-a-like KIND, I totally love it!!!"
1,Really disappointed,Sent this to my mom for Mothers Day - she got a limp 3-color arrangement that was far from the photo! I won't do that again!
5,multi-grain pretzel,"Wonderful pretzels! I purchased these last summer in New Hampshire which started an addiction that has been hard to fulfill because I can't find these pretzels in Missouri. Hence my online purchase. A really good pretzel that's not overly sweet, and packed with flavor."
2,Too oily,"I enjoy many types of tea, the more flavorful the better. I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good. It has a very oily taste to it. I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again."
5,coffee,This is the best coffee I have ever had.  I love Senseo pods. My seller was excellent from packaging to mailing.  5 Star!!
5,She loves it!,"I sprinkle a little of this on my dogs kibble or use as treats while training, and she loves it. Nikita, 60# Husky Shepherd mix."
5,Sodastream,"After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost."
5,French vanilla k cups,So glad these are available!! Not having to go out to get a french vanilla cappuccino is great! We love these!
5,loving the coconut oil,"I absolutely love this stuff,i use it for my hair and i no longer have any frizz and i am totally in love with this product."
3,Coconut Oil,"I bought this item for my hair. I've never eaten nor smelled coconut. So I thought what the hay let me try it. I thought it would be a pleasant smell, but in reality I can't stand it. It seriously makes me want to gag, throw up & die. Okay that's a little exaggerated but SERIOUSLY. It makes me super nauseous & gives me a head ache when I inhale it. I have to mix it with other hair products to ease the smell.<br /><br />On the other hand, this product really has made my hair a little more manageable.<br /><br />BTW a little about me:<br /><br />-Female<br />-18-26 years old<br />-hispanic<br />-curly, fine, dry hair<br />-a lot of split ends<br />-washed daily<br />-takes half a year to grow an inch of hair (seriously)<br /><br />I bought this product to make my hair less dry, & to help it grow and become healthy<br /><br />So far ive been using it 2 times a week for 3-4 hours & it leave my hair soft to the touch."
5,By Nature is dog thumbs up!,"My local pet supply store had By Nature on sale, as he'd gotten a special shipment. My dogs love all the favors and I especially like the teeth cleaning variety. Problem is, these are getting harder to find."
5,cats love it,"my furry kids just LOVE these,cant keep for long,both prefer these Temptations to anything else. Yummy for the tummy,is a must buy"
5,Fantastic (&Healthy) even for the Finicky Feline,"I feed my 3 boys only all natural foods (both dry and wet).  I will even cook for them on occasion.  One of my cats, however, is so incredibly picky, I have gone through countless types/brands of treats and everything to find something he likes but for the last 5 years he will only eat his dry food.  UNTIL NOW!! This is the first canned cat food that he absolutely savors.  I was amazed and pleased to see him get excited when I open the can and lick his bowl clean.  It makes it much easier to maintain a healthy feeding schedule with all of them and I am exceptionally pleased with the results thus far.  Thank you and PLEASE get more in stock!!"
4,Alternative if you are trying to cut sodas/colas,"If you are already drinking healthy/natural/organic beverages, as many other reviewers have pointed out, this has a number of artificial ingredients, so you probably want to stay away from it.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are like me and are or have or had been trying to cut back and eventually cut completely the soda and cola addiction, this can be helpful because it is not addictive like the Colas and it is very quick to prepare, so you can counter the cravings (for worse things) before they build up. It only takes a couple of seconds to squirt a little in a glass of water and then add ice if you prefer. I do only one squirt per drink, press and release, not press and hold. It is small enough you can take everywhere.<br /><br />The taste is reasonable considering what it is and what I use it for. It obviously tastes nowhere near as good as fresh peaches or freshly brewed tea.<br /><br />Having said that, I only use this occasionally to counter cravings and such. I don't think it is a good idea to drink this on a daily basis. But if it can stop you from running to the soda vending machine at work or grabbing a 2-liter cola from the convenience store, it is a small victory."
5,Like Home-Made,"Let me begin my review by stating that I have been a Helmann's mayonnaise devotee for the better part of my lifetime. I have tried many other brands, mainly out of curiosity, and found all of them inferior. Recently, a friend recommended Blue Plate brand. To be honest, I had never even heard of Blue Plate Mayonnaise. To my surprise however, on a recent trip to my local Publix, there it was, in an unassuming blue, yellow, and red container, tucked away on the bottom shelf. Given my frequent disappointments, I was skeptical to say the least.My fears were soon put to rest, however.<br />  Upon first taste, I immediately thought of Helmann's. Blue Plate had a nice, slightly acidic tang that I was familiar with. There was no sweetness whatsoever. The Blue Plate had a nice clean aftertaste, and no heavy off-oil flavor, common to many lesser brands. (Even the much vaunted Duke's brand, which I tried with high expectations, let me down in this department. It tasted heavily of cheap oil.) While the taste is very similar, where Blue Plate is leaps and bounds ahead of Helmann's is in the texture department. For those of you who have ever made home-made mayo, you are familiar with the wonderful, velvety texture that is created. There is a nice sheen, and a good white (not yellow) color. Blue Plate reminded me of this exactly. Unlike Helmann's, there is no ""whipped"" thing going on here - very little air in the mixture, which added to the outstanding, home-made experience. I can see why Blue Plate has been a staple in Cajun Kitchens for the better part of a century.<br />  For those of you who take your Mayo seriously, I strongly recommend Blue-Plate. I really believe you will not be disappointing."
5,Really good quality gum.,"I have been chewing this gum for years now. The flavor lasts for a decent amount of time, about an hour or so. The gum's consistency and texture is perfect, it's chewable for a very long time. The best part is that it is aspartame and sugar-free."
3,Substitution,"This was a re-order of the pods which are very good.  Ordered three boxes and gave them to friends because I told them it was great.  Only later found out that ""instant coffee packets"" of the product had been substituted.  UGH!  Big let down .. will go to BB&B for purchases next time."
5,Yum!,"I read about this flavored tea on a food blog and was immediately interested in trying it. I now have to avoid sugar and sweets as much as possible, meaning having to give up my favorite type of cookie - sugar. I found the tea at Target and have to say it is very good. No, there is no texture of a sugar cookie, however the taste does have a definite effect on your, as one rater noted, senses. If you enjoy sugar cookies, but would like a calorie free treat perhaps this is for you."
2,Taste Strange,"I have been using Coffee-Mate creamer, bought from grocery store's refrigerator section for the past 12 years. Since I was moving to Berlin, and you cannot fine it in Germany I bought 6 boxes of these and took them with me. I could not use even one, since they taste nothing like the ones you buy from the store. I was very disappointed, and will not recommend you to spend your money on this item."
5,Great coffee cheaper at Sams,This coffee is excellent! Strong enough without bitterness.  Cost at Sams here in Texas is 38.00 so it much cheaper
5,Nice variety,Other reviews I read warned of having too many of one type in the box.  Not true in my case - the box had a very nice variety of teas.  there were a couple that had duplicates but that was kind of wahtI was expecting.  I am very satisfied with this transaction.
5,"Addictive, but buy at Costco for half the price.","One can buy this same 2 lb bag at Costco for 10.00!<br />Usually Amazon has the best deals, but not for this item. If you are buying for the<br />health benefits of Gogi berry, it's really a great dark chocolate, with kind of a<br />gummy bear textured fruit mix."
5,Very Good Cashews,I ordered these awhile ago like under a year ago but allmost a year ago. and when they came to me by ups i was suppose to get 12 of them in the box it came in i only got 7. And i called amazon on this and they were very nice to me and gave me a refund. And i got to keep all 7 bags of the cashews and they were very good. I'd prolly get them again but this time i hope id get 12 this time lol.
5,Excellent applesauce!,"What's not to love? It's organic, no sugar added, and it's in convenient 4-ounce serving cups. You just chill in the fridge, peel off the foil lid and enjoy!"
2,Not too thrilled,"I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing."
5,Very refreshingly,No need for sugar just right I eat daily and very delicious.  It has the flavor of the topics with the vanilla. I can always trust Kashi for no corn syrup or hydrogenated so far
5,Wylde Pretzels -- Surprisingly good!,"My 1 and 3 yr old boys brought these home from day care.  My husband and I tried them and ate them all up!  I'm not really a pretzel fan but these don't taste so ""yeasty"" and actually have a slight sweet flavor.  The 1oz bag is a perfect size; you get a lot in this one bag!  Really good and am looking to buy these to take to work for a healthy snack."
5,Delicious!,the product arrived undamaged. they are fresh and delicious. the price is good and it is nice having them delivered to my house. i really like the unfrosted pop tarts the best. i think the crust or pastry shell part is really good. they are worth a try. i am happy that i tried them out.
3,Something different,"This tea is something different for the tea lover looking for a non-caffeinated herbal tea. It's ok, but a little like a watered down chocolate drink. It's ok, and I'll finish it, but I don't think I'll buy it again after all my boxes run out, whenever that is."
5,Coffee with  joy,"As wine lovers say, this coffee has ""nose"". I serve this to customers in my salon who adore the aroma and the taste.  Imagine, the taste and smell of a morning chocolate treat without extra calories. What's not to love?"
5,five star coffee at a one star price,"It's no surprise that there are so few reviews on Amazon for this coffee. While it is one of my favorite bold coffees, probably as good as Timothy's dark roasts (generally $19.00 to $23.00 on amazon in a similar pack); this price, in bulk, is fully 20 cents a serving higher than the 12 pack in my local grocery store. Don't buy it here!"
5,My kids love these raisins and all!,"These cookies are a great quick snack for the kids. They did not even complain about the raisins, I think they gobble them up before they even notice!"
2,Spicy smoked paprika,This product wasn't what I expected it wasn't spicy at all and didn't have a smokey flavor either it had a super light regular store paprika flavor.
4,Cardio Endurance Recovery,"I used to use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JWBZUS"">BSN NO-XPLODE-Nitric Oxide Creatine, 2.25 lbs Fruit Punch (50 Servings)</a>, but after a few months it seemed harsh and left me feeling jittery, even at half strength. I've used other Labrada products and liked them so decided to try this, and after nearly a year I'm still liking it. I usually use it at half strength. I won't make any ridiculous unfounded claims, but for myself I feel it's great before and during intense cardio and helps my endurance. I've taken it on mountaineering expeditions for the ascent, and found it works great for that as well. YMMV."
5,The BEST espresso I've had from a simple machine,"I've always equated cost and complexity with espresso - the more complicated and overpriced the machine, the better the taste. No longer. While the individual capsules aren't cheap (about .70 cents each), the machine is well priced at $400. We go through at least 3 cans a month. Each and every cup is perfect!!! The crema is rich and long lasting. No bitterness. Smooth, rich, and delicious..."
1,These are being taken off the market,"My little Lhasa loved these, but she threw up big balls of starch.  Apparently, this is such a common problem, Zuke's is soon taking this line off the market and releasing a new replacement product in the next few months.  Small dogs don't have the digestive track needed to process these.  They will be switching from the existing potato formula to a more digestible Tapioca line.<br /><br />I need to hand it to Zuke's though. I told them about the product, and they rushed to send me samples and refund my money."
5,These are the low-cal rice cakes!  Light and crispy!,"Our grocery store stopped carrying these, instead opting for a ""local"" brand that is twice as dense, and twice the calories.  These Koyo rice cakes aren't as fresh as the ones I used to be able to buy in our store, but I spread them out on a flat pan and leave in the oven on ""Warm"" for about 5 or 6 minutes.  Then I let them cool completely, and put them back in the bag, and store the bag in the freezer.  This way, they taste very fresh.  I just leave the big shipping box up on a storage shelf, and take out the individual bags one by one to crisp them as I need them."
5,Sometimes quality costs more,"These fruitsnacks are the ONLY ones I will give my child since they are the healthiest I've found. The added bonus is that they aren't as sticky/gummy as normal fruitsnacks, which can get caught in teeth and cause cavities. Being a Dental Hygienist and a Mom, I'm always on the lookout for teeth friendly snacks.<br />My 17month daughter has been given these from before she turned a year old due to the fact that they're very easy to chew.<br />I buy them at Target for much less than on Amazon. I just came on here to see if I could find them in bulk a bit cheaper than that. :)"
5,Finally,We were so happy to find the sour hard candies on line. My guy just loves them and the stores seem to stop carrying them. We were so finally happy to find them here and be able to order them without any hassles.
5,Beignet cafe du monde,The beignets from the cafe du monde are really delicious. Very difficult to do better. also the price is reasonable.<br /><br />I would recommend.
5,Fantastic morning snack or breakfast on-the-go! LOVE Ella's!,"These organic breakfast pouches sell out FAST at the store, and with good reason!<br /><br />We love these breakfast pouches-- they are portable, sized perfectly for kiddo hands, and offer a perfect, wholesome start to the day. All organic with 100% natural ingredients, no pesticides, no chemical fertilizers, no genetic modifications, and no preservatives. The pouches themselves are are BPA and phthalate free.<br /><br />Each pouch holds a serving of organic fruit puree, natural yogurt and brown rice. The combination is tasty, satisfying, and gives kiddos a boost in the morning. We also occasionally use these as a ""Dessert"" at the end of the day.<br /><br />You will be happy with this purchase!"
5,This product is amazing!!!!,"If you like candy and coconut then you need to look no further.  This is the candy for you.  I bought some and put it out for friends, first timers to peach buds and they thought the same.  They immediately wanted to know where to get more."
5,Delicious organic brown sugar!,"It does come all sticky inside, I guess from humidity or whatever else. Thus far I have bought over 18 packs of it, and they all were the same inside, grains sticking to each other. Not that it matters though right? You will put it into your tea or foods and down your throat it goes!!!"
5,Perfect snack,"I'd purchased these based on the reviews here and their reputation abroad. A delightful little tea-time/anytime snack, these little cookies do remind you of graham crackers in taste, but they're not as sweet and have a slight baking soda aftertaste that remind me of Violet Crumbles. The consistency is course grain but crumbly. In your mouth, the cookie falls apart into small crumbs like what you'd find on a graham cracker pie crust.<br /><br />Amazon did a wonderful job in shipping. I know a lot of people have stated that theirs came in crumbled, but almost none of mine were broken. Mine arrived as a box inside a box and had bubble wrap and tacky tape that tried to keep each roll stationary. But another reason for their good condition might have been that they didn't have to stay in transit long. It looks like mine came out of Florida, and they were delivered to South Georgia. Either way, I'm extremely satisifed with the quality and shipping of my purchase."
5,Great product,"I have been feeding cats for a long time, and this is the best quality best tolerated food yet. My cats love it. Their digestive tracts aren't distressed, and the ingredient list alone would sell it. No aritificial colors or preservatives. You will feel good about giving this food to your pet(s)."
5,Great Coffee !,"Wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing. There is no after-taste at all and it very satisfying, you always want another cup of coffee. I continue to buy it."
5,baby food,"this baby food is the greatest.  My granddaughter loves it and even calls it by name. she is 15 months old and still enjoys it, and I have peace of mind because I know I am feeding her a good balanced meal at a great price"
5,Dogs Love Them,"These inexpensive little rewards for dogs seem to be a good quality and very palatable.<br /><br />I've had problems pleasing my dogs as far as tasty treats, some snacks are just completely ignored.<br /><br />I've had no problem with my dog accepting these snacks and actually they consume it eagerly and quick, so it passes the taste test.<br /><br />Sergean't's is an established and trusted name in pet care products and this is a fine product your dog will probably love."
5,enjoy using corainder,"coriander is one of those spices that i found out about a few years back.  it's a mild spice that adds a distinct flavor to many dishes, but is difficult to locate in large quantities.  this is the second purchase of coriander in the last 18 months.  at stores, you can usually find an ounce or two for about half the price of this package.  great product, great vendor and great value."
5,"Good stuff, Great packaging.","Love beef jerky! Have tried many and this is good stuff. It has enough heat without being harsh. This is the first time I have tried Buffalo Bills, and my son and I really like it. Fast shipping and really good packaging. Nice and tender beef. We will be buying more. Try it!"
5,Glad to have found this!,"We used to buy this in the store, but, for some reason they stopped selling this in our area.  Well, I was happy to find it on Amazon.  It tastes so much better than most taco seasoning mixes.  If you are looking for something different (in a good way!) give this a try!"
1,I wouldn't feed this to my dogs,"I LOVE, LOVE, love biscotti.  That said this stuff is HORRIBLE..not really boscotti.  It tastes like old damp then dried cardboard.  I tried dunking it in coffee..again damp the dried cardboard.  I am a diabetic and was hoping against hope that this would be good...not great..but at least good.  I say I was disappointed is a gross understatment..NEVER AGAIN"
1,MADE IN CHINA,"Read your labels, people!!! SMART bones are made in China!!!!!! A neighbor told me how great these were. After buying them, I read the fine print in the back. ""Made in China!!"""
5,Great Product!,"I am new to the Superfood concept, and this is one of the first products I've tried.  It is excellent!  It mixes well with anything I happen to dream up, and I found it easy to substute entire meals with my gree smoothies.  I usually start with some organic tea, add ice cubes, Superfood,  then my ""special"" juices.  I vary between Acai, Mangosteen, and Noni.  And then I also add protiem powder, because I've found that my energy level takes a big dip if I don't suppliment all the green stuff with some protien.  Sometimes I put in a bit of plain yogurt and honey to smoothe it out a bit, but it's not necessary.  I find that I'm sipping on my ""green shakes"" all day long.  Great stuff!"
4,Organic Smoked Paprika,"None of my local stores carry organic smoked paprika, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. I was able to choose the amount that I wanted, it arrived very quickly and it was exactly as it was described.  If you can't find organic smoked paprika locally, I would recommend ordering it from Amazon."
5,quick coffee,"The coffee good for a quick cup in the morning.Easy to fix,and clean up after.enjoy a cup in the morning."
5,Fantastic,My teenagers who are very hard to please simply LOVE this stuff.  Will order again and again.
1,"If you do not want expired product, DO NOT ORDER FROM BURBANK :""OTTOS (EUROPEAN) FOOD STORE"".","The item arrived in January 2012, with expiration date of NOVEMBER 2011. After few emails with dismissive statements like :""the chocolates are still good for several months after the sell by expiration dates"", I decided to accept 50% discount. I have suspicion that this was not a innocent mistake, because the bottoms of all 10 packages look like rubbed off so that the expiration dates were very faint. I was not happy with how the matter was handled and did not appreciate the attitude of representative, which I did expressed in my ""Sellers feedback"". Today I received 2 PHONE CALLS - first to me, but after I refused to discuss anything by phone, my husband , who picked up second call minutes later (which I see as harassment !!!), had to listen the threat that if i would not remove my review, they will set the lawyer on me !!! I do have my phone companies record for that. I never heard of so offensive handling of complaint !!! I do not want anything from this company &lt;&lt;Otto's Euopean Import Store>>> and will not buy from them in the future. All of a sudden the page here has different seller."
5,Just about my favorite K-Cup coffee so far,"Got a Keurig for Christmas, so I've been having fun trying the wide variety of available K-Cup products.  So far, this is my favorite of all the coffees, and one of the few I'd stack up against a good cup of freshly ground and brewed regular coffee. Usually I like K-Cups because they're convenient.  I like these because they're truly excellent coffee and taste wonderful.  These and Coffee People's extra bold varieties are good enough to pass for the real thing - no one would ever suspect they were K-Cups if you didn't tell them."
4,Satisfying with just enough of a tang to make your mouth water,"If you're like me, you try to steer clear of colas and especially anything with high fructose corn syrup, yet you're a bit nervous of the calorie count from, say, orange juice, and you like a bit of sparkle to your drinks, as well. When I saw IZZE, it looked like the ideal solution. It's got a bit of fizz, real fruit juices, and a few vitamins. At 80 calories per 8.4 oz can, it won't break your diet, and it doesn't have any high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />So, how does it taste?<br /><br />Actually, it's pretty good. The pomegranate flavor gives it a nice tang without being overwhelming. The carbonation is light, just enough to give the drink a bit of extra zip without being threatening to overwhelm your stomach. And IZZE is sweet enough that I can enjoy it as a sort of reward for a workout, without being sticky or overly-sweet the way some traditional soft drinks can be.<br /><br />As a test, I tried one can at room temperature--it's a test I won't repeat. But served nicely chilled and straight out of the refrigerator or over ice, IZZE is an enjoyable treat--without completely busting the calorie count."
5,Great deal,"Our terrier mix adores Greenies (haven't met a dog who doesn't love them, actually)... they kind of have a gummy-bear quality. We give him one before we leave for work so he has a little distraction (only takes him a few minutes to finish one). These are $1.50/ea at our local pet supply store, so buying them in bulk is the way to go. We bought them from Entirely Pets and got a great deal with fast shipping."
3,Gluten Wine,"There is no question that with gourmet food, you would expect it to be a great buy at a exquisite price. for Wine.com, they have made some really great products over the past several years. For me though, I would expect them to make a great gift basket for exciting and luxurious lovers of food. Well, they have tried with their gluten free snack basket. The idea isn't such a bad one. Yet you do get what you pay for. The only problem is that you would expect more. While I do enjoy the taste of the pecans and the cracked pepper potato chips. You really would expect it to be less in price for what it is worth, but there could have been much more in the way of food. Still, if you are looking for a nice present for a loved one or a moment of joy, that try Wine.com's gift basket.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+"
5,Great TV viewing.,"I have a lot of free time while I'm sitting in motels. I like taking these old crime shows with me because I can simply watch one show, or several. Joe Penny is great in almost everything he does.  The Fatman adds a little humor to the crime show."
1,way to sweet..,way to sweet..taste like hot sugar water..has no coffee back ground taste..sorry that i bought it..nothing like what you get in a coffe shop..waste of money
5,Very good orange spice tea.,"I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised. Now orange spice tea will always remind me of Hawaii. I bought a box of Bigelow Constant Comment, which is another orange spice tea, but it wasn't as good as Stash's, im my opinion. Stash has much more flavor, and isn't that the point?"
5,helped me quit smoking,plus I gained about 20 pounds! but it worked - have a crave and pop a tootsie pop. I went through boxes of these. I really hate to think of what's in them - all the dyes.... shudder! but smoking is worse and that's GONE! Not a puff in five years. Don't need the tootsie pops anymore either. Try tootsie pops and quitnet.com
5,Great for making coffee smoothies,"A rare find in the US, this Latin American coffee is as good as instant coffee gets. They use a blend of coffee and caramelized sugar to produce this mild, great tasting coffee. I find it works nicely in coffee smoothies and other blended coffee drinks. Once opened, it doesn't keep much longer than a month though."
3,Sticks too expensive,"Besides my morning espresso coffees to wake up promptly, I always loved the Vanilla Instant Coffee in the afternoon. Unfortunately - like other reviewers mentioned - this taste doesn't come in the old containers any longer. It is much too expensive to use 2-3 sticks for one cup with full flavor.<br />Perhaps Nescafe will think that over - IF THEY READ OUR REVIEWS ???<br /><br />PS: At Walmart and Publix a single pack of 20 is cheaper than at Amazon. I'm just saying..."
5,Doesn't get any better!,"We prefer Grade B dark maple syrup over light or even Grade A, for some reason.  Grade B dark just seems to have a more full flavor without being overpowering.  The test comes immediately after opening the container: fill a teaspoon, and taste it straight out of the jug.  I honestly have never tasted better maple syrup - and we've used pure maple syrup for many years, tried a lot of brands and purchased many gallons of it.<br /><br />And if they're able to hold the price at this level, we'll continue to buy it.  Maple syrup has just skyrocketed over the past few years, so we thought we'd been priced out of the market for good maple syrup.  The price on this we a little below others on Amazon.com, and considerably better than anything available in our local grocery stores, plus we were finally experiencing maple syrup withdrawal.  So after having used ""maple flavored"" syrup from the supermarket on our most recent batch of pancakes, we decided to see what Amazon had.  WOW!  We really have not tasted any better maple syrup.  I had to hold back after that first teaspoon to keep from eating another, and another, and....  We satisfied that with pancakes for dinner that night.  :>)<br /><br />This is good - really good!  And we're very careful to reserve 5-star ratings for only the very best."

5,Love this protein drink!,Having my CLICK Vanilla Latte Expresso Protein drink is part of my morning ritual I look forward to everyday! It is a delicious way to get protein!
5,Addictive..in a good way!,My dogs just love these and the chews are safe for them. Their breath benefits from the mint and their dental exams show much less plaque . I must keep bags on hand; they expect them.
1,OVERPRICED.... Go To Walmart Supercenter,Walmart has these for under $4 per 13 ounce jar.  Amazon used to have the 4 pack of these for just over $3 per jar ($12.99 total).  What happened to the fair pricing and the availability at Amazon??????/
1,Yuck-a-moldy,"If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of ""guac-a-mole"" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) ""new look, same great taste"" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the ""Mad-Men"" era I grew up in."
5,Tasty hotcakes!!!!,This mix makes wonderful pancakes.  Only problem is if you don't make enough batter and still want more!!!!  GFM comes through again!!!  thank you for all the wonderful products. :)
5,Can't get enough!,"TLC crackers are amazing!  I am trying to increase my intake of Fiber and lower the amount of fatty snacks I eat.  However, in a way these crackers are a bit bad for me because I usually eat more than the 15 serving size simply because they are too tasy!<br /><br />Kashi has done it again!  The most amzaing wheat crackers ever!"
5,Now's Stevia Extract is Wonderful,"I have been using Now's Stevia Extract for a year now and am totally satisfied.  I like sugar, but not the fat.  Nutra-Sweet and Equal have negative health issues and are expensive.  I use Stevia in my iced tea, on my cerial, and I bake pies with it.  Other than slightly clouding my tea, it tasts wonderfully sweet with no calories.  I like buying it by the pound, and Amazon has the best price."
5,Made my son's party a great success!,"I ordered these gummies last week for an 'angry birds' themed birthday party and they were a HUGE success with the adults and children alike!! I also had angry birds cupcakes and sushi amongst other themed snacks but the gummies WON HANDS DOWN. I ordered the combo case which is 12 theater boxes and not a single one was left at the end of the party! I also used the boxes for decoration since they are super cute and colorful. I scattered them around the table and the kids took turns cutting out the angry birds characters. I tasted the gummies myself and they taste fabulous like they were made with real fruit juice instead of just artificial flavors. So I definitely recommend this product to everyone since it made my son's birthday party a hit! Oh and make sure you order enough, trust me they don't last long! Hearty Appetite :-)"
5,Delicious with a punch!,"I became hooked on these tasty tidbits, but after a while, I couldn't find them at my local stores anymore.  I tried Amazon and found I could order them in packs of six.  While the price is a little higher than I'd like, that is overridden by the fact that I can indeed get them, and they are delivered right to my door.  Ordering two packs gives me free shipping, too. These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!  I've become addicted and don't know what I'd do if these flavored almonds ever become unavailable."
5,Great Pretzels,"I love the Newman's pretzels, both the wheat and the spelt versions.  Not too salty and very crisp."
5,Love these soups!,"When I bought these soups initially (several months ago), I saw the one review. But what that reviewer said about not needing to doctor the soups up for them to be good, really struck a cord with me as that is what I have always needed to do with any soup mixes I had used prior. I also really liked that they only take 20 minutes to make. You can let them stew if you want, but 20 minutes makes a wonderful tasting soup. They have chunky vegis and are very flavorful. I totally love these soups. I have now bought them several times & when ordering again today I thought I needed to also review this great find. I have tried several soup mixes on amazon.com & the Leonard Mountain soups are my favorite by far! 5+ stars :)"
4,Very tasty!,"Wow, these k cups are so yummy and perfect if you are on the go. They don't require cream and sweetener so just brew and go! The only thing I would like better is if they were sugar free using a sugar substitute and were lower fat or fat free. They do taste yummy though and for the price, you can go wrong!"
5,"Mmmm, tasty.","I bought these because I couldn't find them in any of the stores around where I live. My Grandma used to bring me Butter Rum Lifesavers all the time when I was a kid and I have fond memories of sneaking them in my mouth during church on Sunday. :)<br /><br />I enjoyed the product but my goodness, you get enough to feed 60 people! I recommend that you give bags out to your friends and family when you get them!"
5,I LOVE THIS HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE KEURIG!,GROVE STREET HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE KEURIG.  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE HOT CHOCOLATE AVAILABLE TO SOOTHE AWAY THE DAYS ANXIETIES!
5,Superb!,"This is the best tasting tuna I've had outside of freshly caught, ""home-canned"" tuna. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but you certainly get what you pay for! Outstanding taste, very firm meat, no water, just delicious juices from the tuna itself. Amazon does and incredible job packing the tuna, so it gets to you without damage too! Very, very good packaging. Go Amazon!"
5,MMmmmm...,"My cats love this cat food!  All I have to do is stand near the food dish and they begin circling and crying in anticipation.  I highly recommend this product as cats love it, it doesn't smell too bad, and it's easy to find in most grocery stores."
5,Loved it!,"I love this blackberry/vanilla tea from Lipton! The pyramid bags help to distribute the flavor better. Unlike some fruity teas, this is not too overpowering with fruit. It's just the right amount with a hint of vanilla. I've tried it with one bag and with 2. 2 is a bit strong but 1 is just right. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves blackberries and vanilla flavor .... and to anyone who doesn't want anything too over powering."
5,Great!,"Comes in 3 zip-top bags, so you just pour out what you need and close the bag for the next time.<br /><br />Great taste, and much easier than breaking the top off of the McCormick pepper grinder jars (since the store only sells black peppercorn in refill jars)!"
5,Good stuff,"This mix is really really good.  One of the reasons we like it so much is that we can add ""low-sodium"" tomato juice to it and cut down our salt intake a bit.  We love our Bloody Marys, but always felt some guilt about all the salt.  This mix helps, plus it is as good as any pre-mix we have tried.  I highly recommend it!"
5,Great spreads,The spreads are better when left out if you are trying to spread the cheese on a cracker. They don't have to be refrigrated and they are the greatest......I sat and ate one all by myself with crackers......lol.....
5,Only addicted to one kind of candy- Reese's!,"Bought this 4 pack of 11oz Easter miniatures for $5.00 shipped. I got them 4 days ago and already went through 2 bags. Besides these, I eat 110% healthy. I just can't quit Reese's. They're so delicious and addicting!"
3,movie theater popcorn,"I purchased this for my paramount 6 oz popcorn maker figuring it would be easy and quick and no mess, which it was. However, only about half of the kernals popped so thats why I gave it a lower review. The flavor was on the mark for movie theater taste. Perfect salt and butter flavor in my opinion! I just wish more kernals popped!"
5,Impressive Customer Service,"During shipment, the lid detached, leaking the contents of the starter culture. Contacted the seller who immediately responded. Received a personal note stating they would replace the item, that they had identified the container flaw, and had already implemented a new process to ensure it wouldn't happen again in the future. Later the same day, was surprised to receive an email that they had additinally credited my account $10 for delay in receiving (based on original order date, not replacement date). Very impressed. This is how customer service used to be and what every company should strive for. I predict success for this company. Would gladly do business with them in the future. About the product, it is a culture.  I had these growing in my kitchen when I lived in Poland and Russia. Very straightforward and easy to use.....when it arrives (live I hope!) it will do the job."
1,WARNING***COCA LEAF WILL SHOW POSITIVE FOR COCAINE IN DRUG TEST***,"My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com, people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as ""illegal"" by the US Government.<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c technically you DID INJEST Cocaine, just in it's natural form.  The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.<br /><br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com"
5,Kind,This is not the first time I've ordered this product. Love it and will order it again.
5,just what I needed,"I was very pleased with angelinas gourmet. They supplied exactly what I needed, at a fair price, and in a timely manner. Shopping from home is the wave of the future.<br /><br />Dave E"
1,I broke off a tooth on one of these bars,"Into the second bite, one of my teeth broke off.  That was enough to turn me off.  Careful how you chew!"
5,wonderful pet food - poor price point,"Sorry folks but in this day and age of enforced frugality I shop with an eye to the best price point. In this case although I really do love shopping at Amazon for all sorts of items, if their price plus shipping and sales tax doesn't compute then I don't buy it. The product is great for both of my kittens. I have used this particular brand for years including other types for older and mature cats. Their coats are smooth and silky and there is a type of food I believe that helps in the case hair balls! Investigate it. I haven't used this for years.  Anyway a five star review for the item. A thumbs down for the price."
5,Hates to cook,"Love this sauce. Made the creamcheese dip from the website and get raves everywhere I've taken it. Grilling chicken with the Jerk Sauce is out of this world.  Love this sauce, it makes a hates to cook kinda gal look good."
4,Good Cup of Coffee!!!,"I just received this product.  I was a little hesitant with the product not being enclosed in the cup fully, having an exposed filter.  I was pleased with the brewing and taste of the coffee, it was no different than other kcups I have used.  I have a Cuisinart K-cup brewer and it works great with this coffee.  I recommend this product and plan on ordering more."
5,Cheaper at Babies R Us,"This is an excellent product, really convenient for on the go, but I was surprised at how expensive it is on here.  At Babies R Us they are $1.20 each.  Same brand and everything."
5,So Good!!!,"Really tastes like a Margarita.  I blended in some frozen strawberries to try a mock Strawberry Margarita.  I can only say it's so delicious.<br />I love Margaritas, but often pass because of the high calories and Tequila.  Now I can have the taste I love so much in a matter of minutes,  throw in frozen fruit, Tequila or just enjoy it plain.  It's all good!!!"
3,"taste like maple flavor, not extract",I have been searching everywhere for maple extract and was excited to find it on Amazon. I was disappointed that the taste was the same as the 3 different maple flavors that I have used in the past. There is a difference in the taste of a maple cake...which is still yummy....just not as rich in maple taste.
5,Good life recipe indoor formula Works great,"we have successfully been feeding our 2 cats this for about 6 months now comparing this brand to similar brand in this category I would say it exceeds all expectations it is not a high priced <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XKCCV2"">Blue Buffalo Indoor Cat Dry Food, Chicken and Brown Rice Recipe, 15-Pound Bag</a> such as that one at 3 dollars a pound but it is a very reasonable middle of the road cat food for about the same price as cheap cat food so that being said my wife and I are both extremely satisfied with our purchase"
5,I Liked it,I really did enjoy these. The size is perfect for snack time at school and to keep in the car.
5,Love it.,I drink this tea everynight before I go to bed and it helps to relax me and get the troubles of the day off of my mind.  The flavor and aroma are awesome as well.
5,Energy Drink vs Red Bull,"I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.  Quite impressed on just how I can't really tell the difference between this Energy Drink Sodamix and Red Bull, other than the price.  On average I spend about $2.25 per can of Red Bull, and this Sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings, so easy math says $112 for 50 cans of Red Bull or $6.99 for the Sodastream Energy Drink Sodamix 16.9 Fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings.  And as not to be biased, I have a few friends who also drink Red Bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products, and how much money could be saved."
5,Saved my kitty from having dental surgery!,"I have a multiple cat household.  My vet said ""for the health of the animal"" this cat needs to have his teeth cleaned.  Kitty is a rescue and he gulps his food.  I decided to add Hill's Adult Oral Care to his regular food for two months and see if it made a difference.  Two months later, my vet examined him and he no longer needs the cleaning!  Now every tail in my home has this product added to their favorite food."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was prepared to not like this product very much. I expected a drugstore quality product that retails for a salon quality price. I was wrong. The conditioner rinses clean and leaves my color-treated hair feeling noticeably softer than before. I also *really* like the bottle. Somehow, with the cap on the bottom, there seems to be less waste. Now for the cons -- I don't believe the claims that it can really strengthen hair. If you look at the ingredients statement, the nutrients they promote are in minimal supply. That said, I'll continue to use it, even if it doesn't live up to the promises on the label because I like the scent and the soft way my hair feels."
5,Love it!  Get the conditioner with it too!,I saw this shampoo in a magazine and was intrigued by it.  I came and found it on amazon and purchased it along with the conditioner.  I love it.  It is great shampoo and it leaves my hair smelling great.  I can already tell a difference with my dry scalp and my hair looks great too.  I will definitley be buying this again.  It is a wonderful shampoo.
3,Not quite tea,"First of all, let me say that this product is not bad... it actually tastes very good, but there is a misnomer here... it does not taste like tea. Not sure what flavor I would assign to it, but it's certainly not tea - at least not the tea I grew up drinking. Would I buy this again, probably not; their mango flavor is the best by far (5 stars)... But if you try this and enjoy it, more power to you."
5,Yummy noodles,"This isn't your common noodle soup.  You add the paste in after you cook the noodles.  It isn't spicy, tastes good, and light.  If you want something different from your usual noodle soups, I recommend this."
5,Excellent Beginner kit!,I bought one of these kits from the Epcot Center Down in Disney World last fall. Right now my tree is doing great! I was able to keep it alive indoors all winter. I potted it recently and now it is outside and is really happy:-) I think this kit is really good for somebody who is interested in bonsia and is just starting out! The tree that is included is really nice and you get all the supplies to get you going on the right path. Awesome!!!!! :-)
2,Not The Worst but Not The Best,"These are pretty cheap, so we weren't sure what we were going to get. I feel like these are pretty weak, they are alot like the gas station cappuccinos out of the machine but not as strong. I do like that it is only 80 calories, so it's nice to have as a low calorie treat when dieting."
4,Great flavored tea,"This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online."
2,TOO SALTY!!!,"If you are all about eating salt covered chips, you'll be OK. For people who don't like the taste of salt poured in their mouth. Might want to move on. The flavor would be ok, with a less salt flavor. Part of the salty flavor probably comes from the cheese, but it's just too much. Won't be buying these again."
3,Not much flavor,So I even used twice of what it says to use in the recipe on back - still no flavor.  My daughter used the entire package and is all it did to the soup was give it a bit of a warm bite.
1,POOR SUBSTITUTE,"If you are looking for the old-fashioned quality,  you won't find it with this candy.  It is the translucent, waxy substitute for the candy you can't find anymore.  The taste was off, as well--something in between strawberry and sour strawberry.  It is going out in the trash today.  Not worth wasting a single calorie on this stuff. Yuk!  SO, SO DISAPPOINTING."
5,Lemon Ginger Tea with a Zing,"I can't drink caffeine after 2PM so I rely on herbal teas for comfort drinks in the afternoon and evening.  But every once in awhile I want a cuppa that has a bit of zing to it.  This tea is how I get it. [ASIN:B003D4IUUW Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]] - great flavor and an absolutely fabulous price.  And it's delivered to me...I don't have to go try to find it in the local store."
5,Great product - I signed up for auto-ship,Stevia is one of the more healthy sweeteners and this product tastes great - not as great as real Coke with sugar but I really like it better than Coke with Splenda.
5,deez nutz.,great deal on these nuts. whole family loves these nuts. nuts for nuts. arrived fresh and tasty. great for a snack or packed in a lunch.
5,Excellent!,"These are a much tastier than the other flavors, though they are a little softer."
5,Very Happy With This Item!,I was very happy with the taste of this cappuccino!  Unlike the coffee's which i find to be a little strong for my liking this item was perfect! With the coffee i always use the large cup option and add a ton of cream & sugar to make it where it isnt sooo strong.  But the cappuccino is good even in the small cup option! It taste very much like what you buy at a good convenient store from one of their cappuccino machines!  Looking forward to when this becomes available again so I can order more.  You will really want to order this 3 pack instead of a single pack!
5,Yummy and fresh,These were NOT stale. They were as fresh as any I have purchased in my local store. Good quality ... and chocolate ... milky ways are the best!
5,Coffee/blanc and noir,This was a gift for my husband who drinks coffee every morning. (I do not drink coffee.) He says it is an excellent full bodied coffee that is strong but not bitter.
5,delicious.,"I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!"
5,Foojoy Oolong tea,"I love this tea, I usually get it on ebay but this was cheaper. I like to brew it with a cinnamon stick.. its delicious."
4,a little too salty for my tastes....but....,"I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to ""clean"" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own."
5,YUMMY!,"Yummy! Enough Said. These little cookies are so good. Perfect amount of sweetness, chocate and crispness. Will definitely be ordering again!"
5,Fiber One Bars,"For me, the best tasting way to get Fiber,  thumbs up<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FOZ1J8"">Fiber One Chewy Bars 90 Calorie Chocolate Peanut Butter - 20/0.82oz</a>"
5,Great Taste!,"This popcorn is perfectly seasoned and uses oil with butter flavor.  And it's convenient, self-contained in a sealed package.  Just open it and dump it into the popcorn maker.  Ever since I discovered this popcorn, I have not reverted to the old boring popcorn."
5,My dog can't get enough...,"My dog is smitten with these.  She's a little overweight, so we've had to adjust her diet (treats especially).  I thought she'd turn her nose up at these, but she actually loves them more than the higher calorie/fat treats we had been giving before.  Who knew?"
5,"Xylichew is made in Finland, not China.","I am a big fan of Xylichew gums.  My favorite Xylichew flavor is Peppermint - flavor seems to last longer.  Xylichew gums are made in FINLAND.  Cheaper xylitol gums like Spry and most others are made in China.  With all the health scares from Chinese products, I'd rather pay more and go with Xylichew."
2,None of my dogs like it!,"I have three dogs.  Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier.  None of them like this toy.  They have had several Nylabone toys, but this one is the least favorite.  Each of them tried it out, but they all got bored with it fast.  It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp.  That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys.  After handling it myself, I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth."
3,"Good chips, Close to expiration date","These were good chips, but they were a month away from expiration (with no preservatives) when they arrived.  I was expecting them to be good for longer considering it was a pack of 12 bags.  I like chips, but not enough to eat 1.2 bags a day.<br /><br />5* for the chips<br /><br />1* for Amazon selling borderline stale chips"
4,Nice medium flavor,Could use a slightly stronger vanilla flavor. It is a medium strength at this time. No funny aftertaste.  Very good with milk.
5,Popchips,"Excellent Robust flavor, cannot find in Grocery store.  Cheaper than grocery store.Very helpfull for dieters who love potatoe chips, the salt and the crunch."
4,Good product but wrong package,"The Nature Valley bars are in general very good.  They are healthy crunchy and taste good.  However, I didn't see anywhere, but at Costco, the big package with 48 bars.  Since I am a Costco customer, the obvious solution would be to buy at Costco.  Unfortunately they only offer one type of bar on that package size, which is the peanuts with peanut butter.  I don't like much this type because the peanut butter makes it too sweet.  At Amazon, I can find most types, but why do they only sell a 6x6 package and not a 1x48?  They would be able to sell more, 48 versus 36 and the packaging would be cheaper.  In addition by buying in large volume, we wouldn't have to buy as often, which would translate into a shipping and handling savings as well. They could then pass some of that savings to us, the customer, making us happier."
4,Coffee good. Packaging not.,"When I chose the Marley Coffee and Tea One Love coffee, I did not realize they came in ""pods"". (I don't even know what a pod brewer is and wikipedia was no help.) The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.<br /><br />I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.<br /><br />The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod."
5,Red Vines licorice candy,I think everyone has had these and loved them. An American staple. I've been eating them since my youth. Cheap and tasty. Can't go wrong with Red Vines. They are best when they are fresh and not hard. I tend to buy them and they are hard which is a dissappointment. I remember in the early 1990's there was a green apple version of these that was very good or maybe it was another brand. I liked those the best. Never seen them since. Anyone remember those?
1,Gluten free cookies,"Hard as a rock.  Some companies are able to make gluten free sweets palatable, but these are really not very good.  Soaked a cookie in milk for 5 minutes and it did not soften."
1,Tastes like muddy water,"Could not wait til this product hit the shelves. Imagine my surprise when it tasted like muddy water. I couldn't believe it. The whole case went back to Kroger. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I'll stick with Snapple."
4,New No Fear Super Energy Supplement Is Worth A Try !,"This is a new, nice energy supplement drink that can please folks wanting a quick Energy Pick-Up.  It comes in 16 oz. cans containing Arginine, Taurine, and L-Carnitine. The taste is interesting and the product does seem to pick you up.  It contains a HUGE array of desirable supplements, from Sugars, to Folic Acid, To Vitamin B12, Caffeine, and much, much more !!  It's fairly priced, equivalent to products in its class.  If you want a ""pick-me-up"" in the afternoon, this would probably fit your needs !!"
5,My dogs LOVE these,"My two dogs (shih tzu and malkie) love these.  They are more crunchy than jerky, which concerned me at first, but the 'girls' handle nicely.  They receive one treat per day and this is usually it.  I also love that it's made in the USA.  I have repurchased several times and highly recommend."
5,Great and priced right !,"This is great for my espresso Gaggia machine !<br />With subscription you got a quality/price combination that you simply cannot beat.<br />Illy is only slightly better, but twice as expensive, and this Davidoff is better than Lavazza."
5,good stuff at a good price,"I enjoyed having the opportunity to stock up on this Thai Red Curry Paste, which I've used before but which tends to be more expensive than I'd like when purchased in the local store.  It keeps well, and with a couple of cans of coconut milk and plenty of veggies, I've always got the makings of a good, spicy, satisfying meal on hand."
4,great healthy product for my morning breakfast!,"I have to say the very first time i tried better oats i was very satisfied its exactly what i was looking for and which is hard to find. A combination of oats with such healthy elements like flax seeds and barley. I really enjoy my morning breakfast with my better oats, and i plan on re-ordering them in the near future because here in Canada, Montreal, they don't sell it here, hopefully soon enough they will!"
5,THIS FLAVOR MADE ME A TEA LOVER!!!,I have never enjoyed to drink tea... BUT NOW I make myself 2 a day. This tea has such a great taste and a delicious aroma. I definitely recommend this flavor and tea.
5,This is my number one coffee,"I have been drinking coffee, without cream or sugar, for about forty years. I purchase whole bean and grind and brew it fresh. This is a 'blend' so do not expect 100% Jamaican Blue. Last year, I did buy some 100% Jamaican Blue coffee beans at $35/pound. To be honest, I did not really care for the 100% Blue. Maybe the cost affected my taste buds. It is hard to describe taste. To me, this blend is mild and full of flavor as compared to many others. In the past year, I have gone through about fifty pounds of this and still enjoy it.<br /><br />I sometimes like to experiment with different types of coffee beans. The other beans by Magnum, that have comparable types in the local markets, have all been superior in flavor and similar in price to the available local brands. I would highly recommend any of the 'Magnum Coffee' types of coffee. This one is just my overall favorite.<br /><br />Ken"
5,Only Real Wasabi?,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XEL2S"">Fresh Real Wasabi - Six 43g tubes</a>According to informed sources real pure wasabi is very hard to find and very expensive. According Cooks Illustrated Dec. 2009 this is the only pure, authentic wasabi they could find. Most ""wasabi"" products are light green colored ordinary horseradish or horseradish with a minute amount of wasabi. (I have no connection with this company)."
5,"Great stuff,and a must to have","I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me."
5,Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix,The sugarless mix is very satisfactory and it's fewer calories. Go for it.
5,Yummy!,"If you haven't tried these cookies with a glass of milk, you haven't lived!  I bought them in a small grocery in Washington, DC while I was there on business.  I saved the wrapper, googled them and then bought them through Amazon.  Quick service, product was fresh and now I am happy.  Caution, they are addicting so only let yourself have one or two at a time - not the whole box."
5,Delicious!,"I've never been a big fan of oatmeal but I love this stuff! I eat two packets every day before work because it is fast, easy and it fills me up.  I used to think Quaker Oats was pretty good but after trying McCann's, I can't go back."
5,Great Value for a LOT of M&Ms,"What can I say..Amazon does it again...A huge amount of M&M's for a very small price.<br />What makes this a good deal as well is that they are all the individually wrapped M&M packages.<br />These are a great size for snacks, desserts, etc. where you don't want to sit and eat 300 of them..."
5,Yummy!,Use this all the time.  So happy to be able to get a large canister.  Our store only carries in 2.2 oz jars.  Will only buy online now.
5,JRT Loves Them!,Our dog is usually very hesitant about trying something new and walks away from many popular treats.<br /><br />She Loved these treats and never hesitated a bit to try them.<br />Looks like one that will be on my future shopping lists.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon Vine for allowing me to try these out.
4,Energetic Cat!,"I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat."
5,"A Low-Caffeine, Hand-Rolled Fine Green Tea","*****<br /><br />Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: ""Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening.""<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****"
3,Good but too salty,We ordered this item after a friend recommended them.  They are very tasty but salty.<br />The quality is good but the value just isn't there for my family.
5,4 yr old isnt as pleased as she is w/ nutella but....,"my 4 yr old was eating a jar of nutella until i read the label..bad momma i know...SUGAR! anyways i bought this stuff and she isnt aas pleased but she will eat it.  I forced her to the first few times and she got used to the difference.  It is not smooth, gritty, but is healthier than nutella which is why i bought this.  So far so good!"
1,Tastes like cardboard. Don't waste your money,Please don't waste your money. This product has a horrible taste. We followed the directions and it came out of our bread machine looking mangled and twisted with a lumpy texture.
1,Worst Shipping EVER,"I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable. The rest were so badly dented that they were opened and molded. When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!"
3,Spicy NO Nacho,I was extremely disappointed expecting at least a hint of nacho cheese taste but instead there was no cheesy flavor whatsoever &;-(
5,Good coffee!,"Caribou Coffee is definitely some of my favorite coffee.  This 80 K-cup pack was perfect and I will probably order it again when I run out (unless I feel adventurous and try some other brands).  Even arrived a day earlier than the ""anticipated arrival date""."
1,It made me fall asleep,"I drank some to try and keep me awake for an essay, I fell asleep about 15 minutes after drinking it. I don't feel it did anything for me."
2,too greasy,"I use oil on my hair for many reasons. I like to put it on the ends before I blow try it and after for a bit of texturizing. Even just a couple drops on my scalp made my hair look super oily and unclean. So i tried using it as more of a moisturizer for my hair but it didn't really do anything. I'll stick with jojoba oil, thank you. if your scalp is dry, use Clear's Shea Conditioner instead."
5,"Great product, but trust your vet not the hype","I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow."
5,THE BEST lower fat/calorie cheese curl on the market!!!,Few years ago found these in  a local<br /> whole  foods store then later at Safeway- I'm a bonafide cheese curl fanatic and have been<br />Since I was a little girl but as you get older you can't have all that fat and these are<br />FANTASTIC--GREAT FLAVOR AND TASTE AMAZING!!! Soooo HAPPY to find<br />Them on AMAZON!!!!
5,Paul Newman saved my dog!,"Prior to switching to Newman's Own Organics Dog food, my 4 year old shih-tzu was crunching on Iams. Which was fine, except that every 2-3 months or so he'd have stomach problems. After switching, his poops have been firmer, no stomach issues in sight, AND his coat has gotten glossier (and much less flaky). Duncan likes his new food and so do I!"
5,Sweet Leaf Vanilla Creme,"Very nice Vanilla flavor. Very concentrated. I use it in my water, coffee, and make my own soda drink when it's mix with sparkling water. Must have it."
3,Not suitable for under 9 months?,"Our pups ate these, although they weren't entirely enthusiastic about them at first, but I wouldn't deduct points for that necessarily.  What I am concerned about is after I gave them each a chew, I noticed on the bag that these aren't suitable for dogs under 9 months.  I didn't see this mentioned on the product page, and I emailed the company to find out why (is it an issue with a certain ingredient, digestibility, etc.), but have yet to receive a response.  I have two 7.5 month, 50+ lb dogs, so I'm not too worried about the issue, but I'd like to get an answer before I give them more.  This note should be on the product page, as well as in larger print on the package (it's only listed in the fine print on the back) if it's necessary to note in the first place."
5,Good Almonds,"Fresh crunchy almonds, in small packs just right for popping into lunch containers or your purse. Just 100 calories - good for those diet times when you are counting calories."
5,Great mix,This is a great GF mix. I don't have to worry about combining a lot of different types of GF flours together. It does have nuts in them for those who have allergies.
1,Wierd Tasting,"They were distributing these bottles at a station, and i happened to get of them. Just one sip and it i immediately regreted taking this bottle. it has an artificial coconut essence flavour and an even worse mango taste that leves a dry after taste in your mouth. i would not recommend buying it."
3,Good coffee,"This coffee is not really bold in my opinion - it falls more along medium roast flavor. It's a decent, smooth coffee, but I didn't think really bold. Like all k-cups though seriously overpriced!"
5,My 3-year-old loves these!,"My three-year-old daughter calls these ""Arthur Noodles"" and she would eat them every day if we let her.  I feel good that there is no high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oil or MSG.  They are a hit at our house."
5,My fussy pekingese adores this,"The lamb dinner is one of several from Stella and Chew's that I tried after my dog rejected a long line of good quality dog foods. He is healthy and has an excellent appetite but prefers people food. He also likes the beef, chicken and other varieties of this dinner. He looks great and has lots of energy. I'm delighted."
4,"Not my favorite, but an OK substitute","I can tell from the reviews I've read that my opinion will differ from most.  My disappointment with this curry paste is that I found it considerably milder than what has become my standard <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SBB8M4"">Patak's Vindaloo Curry Paste, Hot, 10-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6)</a> which I would absolutely subscribe to if Amazon would ship it here.  Unfortunately for me, they will not :(  So given the general tenor of the reviews and opinion of obviously informed people, I ordered this.<br />Patak's is sold at one health food store on this island (Ohau) and the price has quadrupled in the past 3 years, so I came to Amazon hoping I could get it here.  I can not, but likely you can (they ship to the 48 contiguous states but not Hawaii or Alaska).<br />I found this to be a passable substitute, but prefer Patak's enough that I am willing to pay twice as much if need be.  I will note that this recommendation would only apply to those who like hot curry.  If you thought this was hot, stay away from patak's ;)<br />My work around is to spice this up with patak's pickles <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSQDVS"">Pataks Mixed Pickle 10oz</a> (which I am positively addicted to).<br />I would recommend this for those who do not like hot curry, or who, like myself, are out of range of Amazon's shipping for Patak's.  If they start shipping that to Hawaii, I will switch over without a second thought.  I have it on subsciption now for when I am too tired to make paste, and am out of my preferred.  With only one small store carrying it here, that sometimes happens, so I am glad I can get this to have something on hand for those times.<br />I'll note one other advantage; likely the one which allows amazon to ship here; is that Kitchens of India pastes are packed in foil pouches, so they take up less room in your cabinets.  The premeasured amount is both a positive and a negative.  like with anything else packed in singled-serve it costs a bit more than a jar (for example).  It also does not allow you to easily adjust for your own taste preferences.  I suspect that I'd like it better if I doubled the recommended amount, but that's all I can do; 1 or 2, or... I can not put in a 2 tablespoons vs .5 for example.  For me, this is a serious draw back.<br />In brief, it is a convenient product, makes a nice dinner very quickly, but i find it on the weak side and would switch brands of curry paste if I could get the other here."
5,Wonderful baby food maker,This food maker is wonderful. made carrots as a trial run and it turned out perfect. easy to clean (dishwasher safe) and takes up little space which is perfect for my small kitchen.
5,much better than expected,"These are very tasty indeed.  The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good.  My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of ""Pop Tarts"", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more ""fun"" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies."
4,It's good for the price,"The item was well packed & sealed. I was surprised at the light scent because I've tried other Raw Coconut oil brands that had a stronger yet pleasant (almost tropical) scent. I don't cook with it, I just like it for it's soothing and smoothing properties on the skin. I like the price and the size."
4,good stuff,always a good coffee.  It is not too overpowering with just a hint of flavor.  fortunatley & unlike going to Gevalia direct; buying it from amazon doesn't lock you in to a monthly shipment.
5,Tapioca...beyond the Fish Eye Pudding,"Tapioca starch is a very handy item to keep in the kitchen. It is a thickener, but a very delicate one. There is a very slight sweetness to it that I think adds considerably to duck, chicken or goose gravies, or pork gravy.  The smoothness is like that of cornstarch, and and it gives sauces the same sort of sheen.  Tapioca flour is a good fast fix if your sauce is too thin and you don't know where you went wrong. I have even added a tiny bit to a runny Hollandaise and it worked perfectly. But be careful. Add it in pinches. It thickens quickly and under low temperatures. Don't overdo. And you can freeze sauces or gravies made with tapioca starch. If you use flour, they tend to break down and the texture can be a little grainy.<br /><br />I've bought this under the names Tapioca Starch, Tapioca Flour and Tapioca Powder. So far they are all identical. Bob's Red Mill is reliable. The texture of some of the asian imports is even better, but they're hard to find and not all equal in quality. Bob's Red Mill is a nice go to brand for anything from sorghum, amaranth, coconut and almond flours to fava bean flour. I haven't experimented with most of them, but plan to try the more exotic ones and see what happens.<br /><br />If you read James Michener, you probably remember his recipe for Oyster Stew in ""Chesapeake.""  The description was so mouth-watering, it sent me searching through a one hundred mile radius for an Asian market that sold the ""secret ingredient."" (This was back in those sad, dark days before the internet put the entire world within reach of our credit cards).  Here's how Michener's oysterman, Jimbo, made his He-Stew (a she-stew, fit for ladies, is not, to this lady, worth bothering with). I've reduced the number of onions from 8 to one, oysters from 48 to one dozen (to serve four) and celery to one stalk. If you are cooking for a crew of hungry arstermen, feel free to use michener's proportions.<br /><br />Start with a mess of bacon, one large onion (chopped fine), 1 stalk of celery (ditto), 12 oysters or more to taste (and pocketbook), oyster liquid, tapioca powder, milk, saffron, butter.  Jimbo fries the bacon until it's crisp, sets it aside and tosses the chopped onion and celery into the sizzling bacon fat. He cooks them quickly, so I'm thinking it's just a sweating, not a browning. Anyway, whisk them out after about a minute and add the oysters to the hot fat. You want to put a light browning on them...not cooked, now, just browned.  When the oysters are a lovely golden shade, lower the temp to barely simmering and pour in their liquor; let them simmer until the gills start to wrinkle.  (You want about 1/2 cup, give or take, of oyster liquid. If your oysters come up short, you can add bottled clam juice, chicken stock or water. Clam juice is best. Now throw in a small, and I mean small like 1/8 teaspoonful, pinch of tapioca powder. Remove the pan from heat and you should be able to see the tapioca powder start to thicken into what looks almost like a thin jelly. If this isn't happening, add another 1/8 teaspoon.  Let it bloom for about 3 minutes.  In a separate saucepan, simmer about 2 cups of milk (half and half would be gilding the lily. Don't be tempted. Just plain whole milk is going to be plenty rich). Pour the pan of oysters into the hot milk (Big Jim doesn't drain any of the bacon fat, but it might not be a bad idea to drain all but about one tablespoon of the delicious heartstopper). Then toss in the sauteed onion and celery. You can pour this into a big tureen or individual bowls, and crumble the bacon on top.  Big Jimbo gave it the added blessing of a sprinkling of saffron and, right before serving, a big hunk of butter. I like to serve from a big tureen, so guests know there is plenty and they can ask for more, but I add the butter to each individual bowl, so that melting gold and the buttery fragrance are the first things to hit the hungry crowd.<br /><br />This is so amazingly good, all conversation stops. People just slurp up their soup and their oysters.  Since this is a soup, find the smallest oysters you can. You don't want guests wrassling to swallow an animal as big as their palm.  After everyone has eaten to repletion, those with whom you shared this feast will kiss your hand in humble adoration. I usually serve this with ale, because I think you need something bubbly and tart to cut through the richness and I just like ale and oysters. But something flinty in a white wine, like a steely chardonnay, might go down very nicely.<br /><br />When I make this, I double and sometimes triple the recipe (because everyone wants seconds and, frequently, thirds) and make it a main course with lots of good bread and sweet butter.  Sauteed mushrooms and onions are a nice starter, a leaf or two of salad to follow. This is a good dinner to end with a cheese course, because it's rich, but not heavy and if anyone has any extra room to fill, the cheese hits the spot. Since the meal was creamy, you could jack things up with something sharp like a nice aged Reggiano, and some pears. No dessert is necessary, but if you skip the cheese, poached fruit is nice. If you have port, serve it with the cheese, or use it to poach the pears. It's a killer of a final touch.<br /><br />This is so easy to fix, a last minute dish that takes five minutes to prepare and another ten to make, and it's better than some concoctions that take an entire day of fussing and feuding to get on the table.<br /><br />(My other favorite non-recipe from a non-cookbook is from Peter Freuchen's Arctic diaries. He cooks up a mean Giviak, which is fermented seal stuffed with whole unplucked and uncleaned birds. You don't cook it exactly, you just bury it in the ground for about a year and let everything molder away until the birds taste like gorgonzola. You have to debone the seal without cutting it, so, what with all the hunting involved, there's a lot of prep time even if you don't do anything with the birds but catch them. The only beverge I could recommend is Alka Seltzer, but Freuchen recommends hot boiled moss water. Mmmmm. Moss water.)"
5,I love Moroccan Mint,"Stash is my favorite tea, and by far the Moroccan Mint is my favorite flavor.  I love mint, and the mix of green tea and mint is just delcious."
5,Great Tasting Tea!,Bought this tea for the elderberry included not expecting the best taste.  Found that the taste is excellent!  I have changed my choice of evening drink from decaf coffee to this great tasting tea.  Even my wife has started drinking this instead of her morning coffee.
3,Ice breaker gum,love the gum- HATE the packaging (it is expensive gum too!!). Packaging is VERY bulky and opens in your bag- not sure why the packaged it like this.
